1</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> share which worms have taken in
the formation of the layer of vegetable mould, which covers the
whole surface of the land in every moderately humid country, is
the subject of the present volume.&nbsp; This mould is generally
of a blackish colour and a few inches in thickness.&nbsp; In
different districts it differs but little in appearance, although
it may rest on various subsoils.&nbsp; The uniform fineness of
the particles of which it is composed is one of its chief
characteristic features; and this may be well observed in any
gravelly country, where a recently-ploughed field immediately
adjoins one which has long remained undisturbed for pasture, and
where the vegetable mould is exposed on the sides of a ditch or
hole.&nbsp; The subject may appear an insignificant one, but we
shall see that it possesses some interest; and the maxim
&ldquo;de minimis non curat lex,&rdquo; does not apply to
science.&nbsp; Even &Eacute;lie de Beaumont, who generally
undervalues small agencies and their accumulated effects,
remarks: <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> &ldquo;La couche tr&egrave;s-mince de la
terre v&eacute;g&eacute;tale est un monument d&rsquo;une haute
antiquit&eacute;, et, par le fait de sa permanence, un objet
digne d&rsquo;occuper le g&eacute;ologue, et capable de lui
fournir des remarques int&eacute;ressantes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although
the superficial layer of vegetable mould as a whole no doubt is
of the highest antiquity, yet in regard to its permanence, we
shall hereafter see reason to believe that its component
particles are in most cases removed at not a very slow rate, and
are replaced by others due to the disintegration of the
underlying materials.</p>
<p>As I was led to keep in my study during many months worms in
pots filled with earth, I became interested in them, and wished
to learn how far they acted consciously, and how much mental
power they displayed.&nbsp; I was the more desirous to learn
something on this head, as few observations of this kind have
been made, as far as I know, on animals so low in the scale of
organization and so poorly provided with sense-organs, as are
earth-worms.</p>
<p>In the year 1837, a short paper was read by me before the
Geological Society of London, <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a> &ldquo;On the
Formation of Mould,&rdquo; in which it was shown that small
fragments of burnt marl, cinders, &amp;c., which had been thickly
strewed over the surface of several meadows, were found after a
few years lying at the depth of some inches beneath the turf, but
still forming a layer.&nbsp; This apparent sinking of superficial
bodies is due, as was first suggested to me by Mr. Wedgwood of
Maer Hall in Staffordshire, to the large quantity of fine earth
continually brought up to the surface by worms in the form of
castings.&nbsp; These castings are sooner or later spread out and
cover up any object left on the surface.&nbsp; I was thus led to
conclude that all the vegetable mould over the whole country has
passed many times through, and will again pass many times
through, the intestinal canals of worms.&nbsp; Hence the term
&ldquo;animal mould&rdquo; would be in some respects more
appropriate than that commonly used of &ldquo;vegetable
mould.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten years after the publication of my paper, M.
D&rsquo;Archiac, evidently influenced by the doctrines of
&Eacute;lie de Beaumont, wrote about my &ldquo;singuli&egrave;re
th&eacute;orie,&rdquo; and objected that it could apply only to
&ldquo;les prairies basses et humides;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;les
terres labour&eacute;es, les bois, les prairies
&eacute;lev&eacute;es, n&rsquo;apportent aucune preuve &agrave;
l&rsquo;appui de cette mani&egrave;re de voir.&rdquo; <a
name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; But M. D&rsquo;Archiac must have
thus argued from inner consciousness and not from observation,
for worms abound to an extraordinary degree in kitchen gardens
where the soil is continually worked, though in such loose soil
they generally deposit their castings in any open cavities or
within their old burrows instead of on the surface.&nbsp; Hensen
estimates that there are about twice as many worms in gardens as
in corn-fields. <a name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b"
class="citation">[4b]</a>&nbsp; With respect to &ldquo;prairies
&eacute;lev&eacute;es,&rdquo; I do not know how it may be in
France, but nowhere in England have I seen the ground so thickly
covered with castings as on commons, at a height of several
hundred feet above the sea.&nbsp; In woods again, if the loose
leaves in autumn are removed, the whole surface will be found
strewed with castings.&nbsp; Dr. King, the superintendent of the
Botanic Garden in Calcutta, to whose kindness I am indebted for
many observations on earth-worms, informs me that he found, near
Nancy in France, the bottom of the State forests covered over
many acres with a spongy layer, composed of dead leaves and
innumerable worm-castings.&nbsp; He there heard the Professor of
&ldquo;Am&eacute;nagement des For&ecirc;ts&rdquo; lecturing to
his pupils, and pointing out this case as a &ldquo;beautiful
example of the natural cultivation of the soil; for year after
year the thrown-up castings cover the dead leaves; the result
being a rich humus of great thickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1869, Mr. Fish <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a> rejected my
conclusions with respect to the part which worms have played in
the formation of vegetable mould, merely on account of their
assumed incapacity to do so much work.&nbsp; He remarks that
&ldquo;considering their weakness and their size, the work they
are represented to have accomplished is stupendous.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here we have an instance of that inability to sum up the effects
of a continually recurrent cause, which has often retarded the
progress of science, as formerly in the case of geology, and more
recently in that of the principle of evolution.</p>
<p>Although these several objections seemed to me to have no
weight, yet I resolved to make more observations of the same kind
as those published, and to attack the problem on another side;
namely, to weigh all the castings thrown up within a given time
in a measured space, instead of ascertaining the rate at which
objects left on the surface were buried by worms.&nbsp; But some
of my observations have been rendered almost superfluous by an
admirable paper by Hensen, already alluded to, which appeared in
1877. <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; Before entering on details with
respect to the castings, it will be advisable to give some
account of the habits of worms from my own observations and from
those of other naturalists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Earth-worms</span> are distributed
throughout the world under the form of a few genera, which
externally are closely similar to one another.&nbsp; The British
species of Lumbricus have never been carefully monographed; but
we may judge of their probable number from those inhabiting
neighbouring countries.&nbsp; In Scandinavia there are eight
species, according to Eisen; <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a> but two of these
rarely burrow in the ground, and one inhabits very wet places or
even lives under the water.&nbsp; We are here concerned only with
the kinds which bring up earth to the surface in the form of
castings.&nbsp; Hoffmeister says that the species in Germany are
not well known, but gives the same number as Eisen, together with
some strongly marked varieties. <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a></p>
<p>Earth-worms abound in England in many different
stations.&nbsp; Their castings may be seen in extraordinary
numbers on commons and chalk-downs, so as almost to cover the
whole surface, where the soil is poor and the grass short and
thin.&nbsp; But they are almost or quite as numerous in some of
the London parks, where the grass grows well and the soil appears
rich.&nbsp; Even on the same field worms are much more frequent
in some places than in others, without any visible difference in
the nature of the soil.&nbsp; They abound in paved court-yards
close to houses; and an instance will be given in which they had
burrowed through the floor of a very damp cellar.&nbsp; I have
seen worms in black peat in a boggy field; but they are extremely
rare, or quite absent in the drier, brown, fibrous peat, which is
so much valued by gardeners.&nbsp; On dry, sandy or gravelly
tracks, where heath with some gorse, ferns, coarse grass, moss
and lichens alone grow, hardly any worms can be found.&nbsp; But
in many parts of England, wherever a path crosses a heath, its
surface becomes covered with a fine short sward.&nbsp; Whether
this change of vegetation is due to the taller plants being
killed by the occasional trampling of man and animals, or to the
soil being occasionally manured by the droppings from animals, I
do not know. <a name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a>&nbsp; On such grassy paths
worm-castings may often be seen.&nbsp; On a heath in Surrey,
which was carefully examined, there were only a few castings on
these paths, where they were much inclined; but on the more level
parts, where a bed of fine earth had been washed down from the
steeper parts and had accumulated to a thickness of a few inches,
worm-castings abounded.&nbsp; These spots seemed to be
overstocked with worms, so that they had been compelled to spread
to a distance of a few feet from the grassy paths, and here their
castings had been thrown up among the heath; but beyond this
limit, not a single casting could be found.&nbsp; A layer, though
a thin one, of fine earth, which probably long retains some
moisture, is in all cases, as I believe, necessary for their
existence; and the mere compression of the soil appears to be in
some degree favourable to them, for they often abound in old
gravel walks, and in foot-paths across fields.</p>
<p>Beneath large trees few castings can be found during certain
seasons of the year, and this is apparently due to the moisture
having been sucked out of the ground by the innumerable roots of
the trees; for such places may be seen covered with castings
after the heavy autumnal rains.&nbsp; Although most coppices and
woods support many worms, yet in a forest of tall and ancient
beech-trees in Knole Park, where the ground beneath was bare of
all vegetation, not a single casting could be found over wide
spaces, even during the autumn.&nbsp; Nevertheless, castings were
abundant on some grass-covered glades and indentations which
penetrated this forest.&nbsp; On the mountains of North Wales and
on the Alps, worms, as I have been informed, are in most places
rare; and this may perhaps be due to the close proximity of the
subjacent rocks, into which worms cannot burrow during the winter
so as to escape being frozen.&nbsp; Dr. McIntosh, however, found
worm-castings at a height of 1500 feet on Schiehallion in
Scotland.&nbsp; They are numerous on some hills near Turin at
from 2000 to 3000 feet above the sea, and at a great altitude on
the Nilgiri Mountains in South India and on the Himalaya.</p>
<p>Earth-worms must be considered as terrestrial animals, though
they are still in one sense semi-aquatic, like the other members
of the great class of annelids to which they belong.&nbsp; M.
Perrier found that their exposure to the dry air of a room for
only a single night was fatal to them.&nbsp; On the other hand he
kept several large worms alive for nearly four months, completely
submerged in water. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; During the
summer when the ground is dry, they penetrate to a considerable
depth and cease to work, as they do during the winter when the
ground is frozen.&nbsp; Worms are nocturnal in their habits, and
at night may be seen crawling about in large numbers, but usually
with their tails still inserted in their burrows.&nbsp; By the
expansion of this part of their bodies, and with the help of the
short, slightly reflexed bristles, with which their bodies are
armed, they hold so fast that they can seldom be dragged out of
the ground without being torn into pieces. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; During the day they remain in
their burrows, except at the pairing season, when those which
inhabit adjoining burrows expose the greater part of their bodies
for an hour or two in the early morning.&nbsp; Sick individuals,
which are generally affected by the parasitic larv&aelig; of a
fly, must also be excepted, as they wander about during the day
and die on the surface.&nbsp; After heavy rain succeeding dry
weather, an astonishing number of dead worms may sometimes be
seen lying on the ground.&nbsp; Mr. Galton informs me that on one
such occasion (March, 1881), the dead worms averaged one for
every two and a half paces in length on a walk in Hyde Park, four
paces in width.&nbsp; He counted no less than 45 dead worms in
one place in a length of sixteen paces.&nbsp; From the facts
above given, it is not probable that these worms could have been
drowned, and if they had been drowned they would have perished in
their burrows.&nbsp; I believe that they were already sick, and
that their deaths were merely hastened by the ground being
flooded.</p>
<p>It has often been said that under ordinary circumstances
healthy worms never, or very rarely, completely leave their
burrows at night; but this is an error, as White of Selborne long
ago knew.&nbsp; In the morning, after there has been heavy rain,
the film of mud or of very fine sand over gravel-walks is often
plainly marked with their tracks.&nbsp; I have noticed this from
August to May, both months included, and it probably occurs
during the two remaining months of the year when they are
wet.&nbsp; On these occasions, very few dead worms could anywhere
be seen.&nbsp; On January 31, 1881, after a long-continued and
unusually severe frost with much snow, as soon as a thaw set in,
the walks were marked with innumerable tracks.&nbsp; On one
occasion, five tracks were counted crossing a space of only an
inch square.&nbsp; They could sometimes be traced either to or
from the mouths of the burrows in the gravel-walks, for distances
between 2 or 3 up to 15 yards.&nbsp; I have never seen two tracks
leading to the same burrow; nor is it likely, from what we shall
presently see of their sense-organs, that a worm could find its
way back to its burrow after having once left it.&nbsp; They
apparently leave their burrows on a voyage of discovery, and thus
they find new sites to inhabit.</p>
<p>Morren states <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a> that worms often lie for hours almost
motionless close beneath the mouths of their burrows.&nbsp; I
have occasionally noticed the same fact with worms kept in pots
in the house; so that by looking down into their burrows, their
heads could just be seen.&nbsp; If the ejected earth or rubbish
over the burrows be suddenly removed, the end of the worm&rsquo;s
body may very often be seen rapidly retreating.&nbsp; This habit
of lying near the surface leads to their destruction to an
immense extent.&nbsp; Every morning during certain seasons of the
year, the thrushes and blackbirds on all the lawns throughout the
country draw out of their holes an astonishing number of worms,
and this they could not do, unless they lay close to the
surface.&nbsp; It is not probable that worms behave in this
manner for the sake of breathing fresh air, for we have seen that
they can live for a long time under water.&nbsp; I believe that
they lie near the surface for the sake of warmth, especially in
the morning; and we shall hereafter find that they often coat the
mouths of their burrows with leaves, apparently to prevent their
bodies from coming into close contact with the cold damp
earth.&nbsp; It is said that they completely close their burrows
during the winter.</p>
<p><i>Structure</i>.&mdash;A few remarks must be made on this
subject.&nbsp; The body of a large worm consists of from 100 to
200 almost cylindrical rings or segments, each furnished with
minute bristles.&nbsp; The muscular system is well
developed.&nbsp; Worms can crawl backwards as well as forwards,
and by the aid of their affixed tails can retreat with
extraordinary rapidity into their burrows.&nbsp; The mouth is
situated at the anterior end of the body, and is provided with a
little projection (lobe or lip, as it has been variously called)
which is used for prehension.&nbsp; Internally, behind the mouth,
there is a strong pharynx, shown in the accompanying diagram
(Fig. 1) which is pushed forwards when the animal eats, and this
part corresponds, according to Perrier, with the protrudable
trunk or proboscis of other annelids.&nbsp; The pharynx leads
into the &oelig;sophagus, on each side of which in the lower part
there are three pairs of large glands, which secrete a surprising
amount of carbonate of lime.&nbsp; These calciferous glands are
highly remarkable, for nothing like them is known in any other
animal.&nbsp; Their use will be discussed when we treat of the
digestive process.&nbsp; In most of the species, the
&oelig;sophagus is enlarged into a crop in front of the
gizzard.&nbsp; This latter organ is lined with a smooth thick
chitinous membrane, and is surrounded by weak longitudinal, but
powerful transverse muscles.&nbsp; Perrier saw these muscles in
energetic action; and, as he remarks, the trituration of the food
must be chiefly effected by this organ, for worms possess no jaws
or teeth of any kind.&nbsp; Grains of sand and small stones, from
the 1/20 to a little more than the 1/10 inch in diameter, may
generally be found in their gizzards and intestines.&nbsp; As it
is certain that worms swallow many little stones, independently
of those swallowed while excavating their burrows, it is probable
that they serve, like mill-stones, to triturate their food.&nbsp;
The gizzard opens into the intestine, which runs in a straight
course to the vent at the posterior end of the body.&nbsp; The
intestine presents a remarkable structure, the typhlosolis, or,
as the old anatomists called it, an intestine within an
intestine; and Clapar&egrave;de <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a> has shown that this
consists of a deep longitudinal involution of the walls of the
intestine, by which means an extensive absorbent surface is
gained.</p>

<p>The circulatory system is well developed.&nbsp; Worms breathe
by their skin, as they do not possess any special respiratory
organs.&nbsp; The two sexes are united in the same individual,
but two individuals pair together.&nbsp; The nervous system is
fairly well developed; and the two almost confluent cerebral
ganglia are situated very near to the anterior end of the
body.</p>
<p><i>Senses</i>.&mdash;Worms are destitute of eyes, and at first
I thought that they were quite insensible to light; for those
kept in confinement were repeatedly observed by the aid of a
candle, and others out of doors by the aid of a lantern, yet they
were rarely alarmed, although extremely timid animals.&nbsp;
Other persons have found no difficulty in observing worms at
night by the same means. <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a></p>
<p>Hoffmeister, however, states <a name="citation18b"></a><a
href="#footnote18b" class="citation">[18b]</a> that worms, with
the exception of a few individuals, are extremely sensitive to
light; but he admits that in most cases a certain time is
requisite for its action.&nbsp; These statements led me to watch
on many successive nights worms kept in pots, which were
protected from currents of air by means of glass plates.&nbsp;
The pots were approached very gently, in order that no vibration
of the floor should be caused.&nbsp; When under these
circumstances worms were illuminated by a bull&rsquo;s-eye
lantern having slides of dark red and blue glass, which
intercepted so much light that they could be seen only with some
difficulty, they were not at all affected by this amount of
light, however long they were exposed to it.&nbsp; The light, as
far as I could judge, was brighter than that from the full
moon.&nbsp; Its colour apparently made no difference in the
result.&nbsp; When they were illuminated by a candle, or even by
a bright paraffin lamp, they were not usually affected at
first.&nbsp; Nor were they when the light was alternately
admitted and shut off.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, they behaved
very differently, for as soon as the light fell on them, they
withdrew into their burrows with almost instantaneous
rapidity.&nbsp; This occurred perhaps once out of a dozen
times.&nbsp; When they did not withdraw instantly, they often
raised the anterior tapering ends of their bodies from the
ground, as if their attention was aroused or as if surprise was
felt; or they moved their bodies from side to side as if feeling
for some object.&nbsp; They appeared distressed by the light; but
I doubt whether this was really the case, for on two occasions
after withdrawing slowly, they remained for a long time with
their anterior extremities protruding a little from the mouths of
their burrows, in which position they were ready for instant and
complete withdrawal.</p>
<p>When the light from a candle was concentrated by means of a
large lens on the anterior extremity, they generally withdrew
instantly; but this concentrated light failed to act perhaps once
out of half a dozen trials.&nbsp; The light was on one occasion
concentrated on a worm lying beneath water in a saucer, and it
instantly withdrew into its burrow.&nbsp; In all cases the
duration of the light, unless extremely feeble, made a great
difference in the result; for worms left exposed before a
paraffin lamp or a candle invariably retreated into their burrows
within from five to fifteen minutes; and if in the evening the
pots were illuminated before the worms had come out of their
burrows, they failed to appear.</p>
<p>From the foregoing facts it is evident that light affects
worms by its intensity and by its duration.&nbsp; It is only the
anterior extremity of the body, where the cerebral ganglia lie,
which is affected by light, as Hoffmeister asserts, and as I
observed on many occasions.&nbsp; If this part is shaded, other
parts of the body may be fully illuminated, and no effect will be
produced.&nbsp; As these animals have no eyes, we must suppose
that the light passes through their skins, and in some manner
excites their cerebral ganglia.&nbsp; It appeared at first
probable that the different manner in which they were affected on
different occasions might be explained, either by the degree of
extension of their skin and its consequent transparency, or by
some particular incident of the light; but I could discover no
such relation.&nbsp; One thing was manifest, namely, that when
worms were employed in dragging leaves into their burrows or in
eating them, and even during the short intervals whilst they
rested from their work, they either did not perceive the light or
were regardless of it; and this occurred even when the light was
concentrated on them through a large lens.&nbsp; So, again,
whilst they are paired, they will remain for an hour or two out
of their burrows, fully exposed to the morning light; but it
appears from what Hoffmeister says that a light will occasionally
cause paired individuals to separate.</p>
<p>When a worm is suddenly illuminated and dashes like a rabbit
into its burrow&mdash;to use the expression employed by a
friend&mdash;we are at first led to look at the action as a
reflex one.&nbsp; The irritation of the cerebral ganglia appears
to cause certain muscles to contract in an inevitable manner,
independently of the will or consciousness of the animal, as if
it were an automaton.&nbsp; But the different effect which a
light produced on different occasions, and especially the fact
that a worm when in any way employed and in the intervals of such
employment, whatever set of muscles and ganglia may then have
been brought into play, is often regardless of light, are opposed
to the view of the sudden withdrawal being a simple reflex
action.&nbsp; With the higher animals, when close attention to
some object leads to the disregard of the impressions which other
objects must be producing on them, we attribute this to their
attention being then absorbed; and attention implies the presence
of a mind.&nbsp; Every sportsman knows that he can approach
animals whilst they are grazing, fighting or courting, much more
easily than at other times.&nbsp; The state, also, of the nervous
system of the higher animals differs much at different times, for
instance, a horse is much more readily startled at one time than
at another.&nbsp; The comparison here implied between the actions
of one of the higher animals and of one so low in the scale as an
earth-worm, may appear far-fetched; for we thus attribute to the
worm attention and some mental power, nevertheless I can see no
reason to doubt the justice of the comparison.</p>
<p>Although worms cannot be said to possess the power of vision,
their sensitiveness to light enables them to distinguish between
day and night; and they thus escape extreme danger from the many
diurnal animals which prey on them.&nbsp; Their withdrawal into
their burrows during the day appears, however, to have become an
habitual action; for worms kept in pots covered by glass plates,
over which sheets of black paper were spread, and placed before a
north-east window, remained during the day-time in their burrows
and came out every night; and they continued thus to act for a
week.&nbsp; No doubt a little light may have entered between the
sheets of glass and the blackened paper; but we know from the
trials with coloured glass, that worms are indifferent to a small
amount of light.</p>
<p>Worms appear to be less sensitive to moderate radiant heat
than to a bright light.&nbsp; I judge of this from having held at
different times a poker heated to dull redness near some worms,
at a distance which caused a very sensible degree of warmth in my
hand.&nbsp; One of them took no notice; a second withdrew into
its burrow, but not quickly; the third and fourth much more
quickly, and the fifth as quickly as possible.&nbsp; The light
from a candle, concentrated by a lens and passing through a sheet
of glass which would intercept most of the heat-rays, generally
caused a much more rapid retreat than did the heated poker.&nbsp;
Worms are sensitive to a low temperature, as may be inferred from
their not coming out of their burrows during a frost.</p>
<p>Worms do not possess any sense of hearing.&nbsp; They took not
the least notice of the shrill notes from a metal whistle, which
was repeatedly sounded near them; nor did they of the deepest and
loudest tones of a bassoon.&nbsp; They were indifferent to
shouts, if care was taken that the breath did not strike
them.&nbsp; When placed on a table close to the keys of a piano,
which was played as loudly as possible, they remained perfectly
quiet.</p>
<p>Although they are indifferent to undulations in the air
audible by us, they are extremely sensitive to vibrations in any
solid object.&nbsp; When the pots containing two worms which had
remained quite indifferent to the sound of the piano, were placed
on this instrument, and the note C in the bass clef was struck,
both instantly retreated into their burrows.&nbsp; After a time
they emerged, and when G above the line in the treble clef was
struck they again retreated.&nbsp; Under similar circumstances on
another night one worm dashed into its burrow on a very high note
being struck only once, and the other worm when C in the treble
clef was struck.&nbsp; On these occasions the worms were not
touching the sides of the pots, which stood in saucers; so that
the vibrations, before reaching their bodies, had to pass from
the sounding board of the piano, through the saucer, the bottom
of the pot and the damp, not very compact earth on which they lay
with their tails in their burrows.&nbsp; They often showed their
sensitiveness when the pot in which they lived, or the table on
which the pot stood, was accidentally and lightly struck; but
they appeared less sensitive to such jars than to the vibrations
of the piano; and their sensitiveness to jars varied much at
different times.</p>
<p>It has often been said that if the ground is beaten or
otherwise made to tremble, worms believe that they are pursued by
a mole and leave their burrows.&nbsp; From one account that I
have received, I have no doubt that this is often the case; but a
gentleman informs me that he lately saw eight or ten worms leave
their burrows and crawl about the grass on some boggy land on
which two men had just trampled while setting a trap; and this
occurred in a part of Ireland where there were no moles.&nbsp; I
have been assured by a Volunteer that he has often seen many
large earth-worms crawling quickly about the grass, a few minutes
after his company had fired a volley with blank cartridges.&nbsp;
The Peewit (<i>Tringa vanellus</i>, Linn.) seems to know
instinctively that worms will emerge if the ground is made to
tremble; for Bishop Stanley states (as I hear from Mr. Moorhouse)
that a young peewit kept in confinement used to stand on one leg
and beat the turf with the other leg until the worms crawled out
of their burrows, when they were instantly devoured.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, worms do not invariably leave their burrows when
the ground is made to tremble, as I know by having beaten it with
a spade, but perhaps it was beaten too violently.</p>
<p>The whole body of a worm is sensitive to contact.&nbsp; A
slight puff of air from the mouth causes an instant
retreat.&nbsp; The glass plates placed over the pots did not fit
closely, and blowing through the very narrow chinks thus left,
often sufficed to cause a rapid retreat.&nbsp; They sometimes
perceived the eddies in the air caused by quickly removing the
glass plates.&nbsp; When a worm first comes out of its burrow, it
generally moves the much extended anterior extremity of its body
from side to side in all directions, apparently as an organ of
touch; and there is some reason to believe, as we shall see in
the next chapter, that they are thus enabled to gain a general
notion of the form of an object.&nbsp; Of all their senses that
of touch, including in this term the perception of a vibration,
seems much the most highly developed.</p>
<p>In worms the sense of smell apparently is confined to the
perception of certain odours, and is feeble.&nbsp; They were
quite indifferent to my breath, as long as I breathed on them
very gently.&nbsp; This was tried, because it appeared possible
that they might thus be warned of the approach of an enemy.&nbsp;
They exhibited the same indifference to my breath whilst I chewed
some tobacco, and while a pellet of cotton-wool with a few drops
of millefleurs perfume or of acetic acid was kept in my
mouth.&nbsp; Pellets of cotton-wool soaked in tobacco juice, in
millefleurs perfume, and in paraffin, were held with pincers and
were waved about within two or three inches of several worms, but
they took no notice.&nbsp; On one or two occasions, however, when
acetic acid had been placed on the pellets, the worms appeared a
little uneasy, and this was probably due to the irritation of
their skins.&nbsp; The perception of such unnatural odours would
be of no service to worms; and as such timid creatures would
almost certainly exhibit some signs of any new impression, we may
conclude that they did not perceive these odours.</p>
<p>The result was different when cabbage-leaves and pieces of
onion were employed, both of which are devoured with much relish
by worms.&nbsp; Small square pieces of fresh and half-decayed
cabbage-leaves and of onion bulbs were on nine occasions buried
in my pots, beneath about &frac14; of an inch of common garden
soil; and they were always discovered by the worms.&nbsp; One bit
of cabbage was discovered and removed in the course of two hours;
three were removed by the next morning, that is, after a single
night; two others after two nights; and the seventh bit after
three nights.&nbsp; Two pieces of onion were discovered and
removed after three nights.&nbsp; Bits of fresh raw meat, of
which worms are very fond, were buried, and were not discovered
within forty-eight hours, during which time they had not become
putrid.&nbsp; The earth above the various buried objects was
generally pressed down only slightly, so as not to prevent the
emission of any odour.&nbsp; On two occasions, however, the
surface was well watered, and was thus rendered somewhat
compact.&nbsp; After the bits of cabbage and onion had been
removed, I looked beneath them to see whether the worms had
accidentally come up from below, but there was no sign of a
burrow; and twice the buried objects were laid on pieces of
tin-foil which were not in the least displaced.&nbsp; It is of
course possible that the worms whilst moving about on the surface
of the ground, with their tails affixed within their burrows, may
have poked their heads into the places where the above objects
were buried; but I have never seen worms acting in this
manner.&nbsp; Some pieces of cabbage-leaf and of onion were twice
buried beneath very fine ferruginous sand, which was slightly
pressed down and well watered, so as to be rendered very compact,
and these pieces were never discovered.&nbsp; On a third occasion
the same kind of sand was neither pressed down nor watered, and
the pieces of cabbage were discovered and removed after the
second night.&nbsp; These several facts indicate that worms
possess some power of smell; and that they discover by this means
odoriferous and much-coveted kinds of food.</p>
<p>It may be presumed that all animals which feed on various
substances possess the sense of taste, and this is certainly the
case with worms.&nbsp; Cabbage-leaves are much liked by worms;
and it appears that they can distinguish between different
varieties; but this may perhaps be owing to differences in their
texture.&nbsp; On eleven occasions pieces of the fresh leaves of
a common green variety and of the red variety used for pickling
were given them, and they preferred the green, the red being
either wholly neglected or much less gnawed.&nbsp; On two other
occasions, however, they seemed to prefer the red.&nbsp;
Half-decayed leaves of the red variety and fresh leaves of the
green were attacked about equally.&nbsp; When leaves of the
cabbage, horse-radish (a favourite food) and of the onion were
given together, the latter were always, and manifestly
preferred.&nbsp; Leaves of the cabbage, lime-tree, Ampelopsis,
parsnip (Pastinaca), and celery (Apium) were likewise given
together; and those of the celery were first eaten.&nbsp; But
when leaves of cabbage, turnip, beet, celery, wild cherry and
carrots were given together, the two latter kinds, especially
those of the carrot, were preferred to all the others, including
those of celery.&nbsp; It was also manifest after many trials
that wild cherry leaves were greatly preferred to those of the
lime-tree and hazel (Corylus).&nbsp; According to Mr. Bridgman
the half-decayed leaves of <i>Phlox verna</i> are particularly
liked by worms. <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>Pieces of the leaves of cabbage, turnip, horse-radish and
onion were left on the pots during 22 days, and were all attacked
and had to be renewed; but during the whole of this time leaves
of an Artemisia and of the culinary sage, thyme and mint, mingled
with the above leaves, were quite neglected excepting those of
the mint, which were occasionally and very slightly
nibbled.&nbsp; These latter four kinds of leaves do not differ in
texture in a manner which could make them disagreeable to worms;
they all have a strong taste, but so have the four first
mentioned kinds of leaves; and the wide difference in the result
must be attributed to a preference by the worms for one taste
over another.</p>
<p><i>Mental Qualities</i>.&mdash;There is little to be said on
this head.&nbsp; We have seen that worms are timid.&nbsp; It may
be doubted whether they suffer as much pain when injured, as they
seem to express by their contortions.&nbsp; Judging by their
eagerness for certain kinds of food, they must enjoy the pleasure
of eating.&nbsp; Their sexual passion is strong enough to
overcome for a time their dread of light.&nbsp; They perhaps have
a trace of social feeling, for they are not disturbed by crawling
over each other&rsquo;s bodies, and they sometimes lie in
contact.&nbsp; According to Hoffmeister they pass the winter
either singly or rolled up with others into a ball at the bottom
of their burrows. <a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; Although worms are so remarkably
deficient in the several sense-organs, this does not necessarily
preclude intelligence, as we know from such cases as those of
Laura Bridgman; and we have seen that when their attention is
engaged, they neglect impressions to which they would otherwise
have attended; and attention indicates the presence of a mind of
some kind.&nbsp; They are also much more easily excited at
certain times than at others.&nbsp; They perform a few actions
instinctively, that is, all the individuals, including the young,
perform such actions in nearly the same fashion.&nbsp; This is
shown by the manner in which the species of Perich&aelig;ta eject
their castings, so as to construct towers; also by the manner in
which the burrows of the common earth-worm are smoothly lined
with fine earth and often with little stones, and the mouths of
their burrows with leaves.&nbsp; One of their strongest instincts
is the plugging up the mouths of their burrows with various
objects; and very young worms act in this manner.&nbsp; But some
degree of intelligence appears, as we shall see in the next
chapter, to be exhibited in this work,&mdash;a result which has
surprised me more than anything else in regard to worms.</p>
<p><i>Food and Digestion</i>.&mdash;Worms are omnivorous.&nbsp;
They swallow an enormous quantity of earth, out of which they
extract any digestible matter which it may contain; but to this
subject I must recur.&nbsp; They also consume a large number of
half-decayed leaves of all kinds, excepting a few which have an
unpleasant taste or are too tough for them; likewise petioles,
peduncles, and decayed flowers.&nbsp; But they will also consume
fresh leaves, as I have found by repeated trials.&nbsp; According
to Morren <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a> they will eat particles of sugar and
liquorice; and the worms which I kept drew many bits of dry
starch into their burrows, and a large bit had its angles well
rounded by the fluid poured out of their mouths.&nbsp; But as
they often drag particles of soft stone, such as of chalk, into
their burrows, I feel some doubt whether the starch was used as
food.&nbsp; Pieces of raw and roasted meat were fixed several
times by long pins to the surface of the soil in my pots, and
night after night the worms could be seen tugging at them, with
the edges of the pieces engulfed in their mouths, so that much
was consumed.&nbsp; Raw fat seems to be preferred even to raw
meat or to any other substance which was given them, and much was
consumed.&nbsp; They are cannibals, for the two halves of a dead
worm placed in two of the pots were dragged into the burrows and
gnawed; but as far as I could judge, they prefer fresh to putrid
meat, and in so far I differ from Hoffmeister.</p>
<p>L&eacute;on Fredericq states <a name="citation34"></a><a
href="#footnote34" class="citation">[34]</a> that the digestive
fluid of worms is of the same nature as the pancreatic secretion
of the higher animals; and this conclusion agrees perfectly with
the kinds of food which worms consume.&nbsp; Pancreatic juice
emulsifies fat, and we have just seen how greedily worms devour
fat; it dissolves fibrin, and worms eat raw meat; it converts
starch into grape-sugar with wonderful rapidity, and we shall
presently show that the digestive fluid of worms acts on starch.
<a name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a>&nbsp; But they live chiefly on
half-decayed leaves; and these would be useless to them unless
they could digest the cellulose forming the cell-walls; for it is
well known that all other nutritious substances are almost
completely withdrawn from leaves, shortly before they fall
off.&nbsp; It has, however, now been ascertained that some forms
of cellulose, though very little or not at all attacked by the
gastric secretion of the higher animals, are acted on by that
from the pancreas. <a name="citation35b"></a><a
href="#footnote35b" class="citation">[35b]</a></p>
<p>The half-decayed or fresh leaves which worms intend to devour,
are dragged into the mouths of their burrows to a depth of from
one to three inches, and are then moistened with a secreted
fluid.&nbsp; It has been assumed that this fluid serves to hasten
their decay; but a large number of leaves were twice pulled out
of the burrows of worms and kept for many weeks in a very moist
atmosphere under a bell-glass in my study; and the parts which
had been moistened by the worms did not decay more quickly in any
plain manner than the other parts.&nbsp; When fresh leaves were
given in the evening to worms kept in confinement and examined
early on the next morning, therefore not many hours after they
had been dragged into the burrows, the fluid with which they were
moistened, when tested with neutral litmus paper, showed an
alkaline reaction.&nbsp; This was repeatedly found to be the case
with celery, cabbage and turnip leaves.&nbsp; Parts of the same
leaves which had not been moistened by the worms, were pounded
with a few drops of distilled water, and the juice thus extracted
was not alkaline.&nbsp; Some leaves, however, which had been
drawn into burrows out of doors, at an unknown antecedent period,
were tried, and though still moist, they rarely exhibited even a
trace of alkaline reaction.</p>
<p>The fluid, with which the leaves are bathed, acts on them
whilst they are fresh or nearly fresh, in a remarkable manner;
for it quickly kills and discolours them.&nbsp; Thus the ends of
a fresh carrot-leaf, which had been dragged into a burrow, were
found after twelve hours of a dark brown tint.&nbsp; Leaves of
celery, turnip, maple, elm, lime, thin leaves of ivy, and,
occasionally those of the cabbage were similarly acted on.&nbsp;
The end of a leaf of <i>Triticum repens</i>, still attached to a
growing plant, had been drawn into a burrow, and this part was
dark brown and dead, whilst the rest of the leaf was fresh and
green.&nbsp; Several leaves of lime and elm removed from burrows
out of doors were found affected in different degrees.&nbsp; The
first change appears to be that the veins become of a dull
reddish-orange.&nbsp; The cells with chlorophyll next lose more
or less completely their green colour, and their contents finally
become brown.&nbsp; The parts thus affected often appeared almost
black by reflected light; but when viewed as a transparent object
under the microscope, minute specks of light were transmitted,
and this was not the case with the unaffected parts of the same
leaves.&nbsp; These effects, however, merely show that the
secreted fluid is highly injurious or poisonous to leaves; for
nearly the same effects were produced in from one to two days on
various kinds of young leaves, not only by artificial pancreatic
fluid, prepared with or without thymol, but quickly by a solution
of thymol by itself.&nbsp; On one occasion leaves of Corylus were
much discoloured by being kept for eighteen hours in pancreatic
fluid, without any thymol.&nbsp; With young and tender leaves
immersion in human saliva during rather warm weather, acted in
the same manner as the pancreatic fluid, but not so
quickly.&nbsp; The leaves in all these cases often became
infiltrated with the fluid.</p>
<p>Large leaves from an ivy plant growing on a wall were so tough
that they could not be gnawed by worms, but after four days they
were affected in a peculiar manner by the secretion poured out of
their mouths.&nbsp; The upper surfaces of the leaves, over which
the worms had crawled, as was shown by the dirt left on them,
were marked in sinuous lines, by either a continuous or broken
chain of whitish and often star-shaped dots, about 2 mm. in
diameter.&nbsp; The appearance thus presented was curiously like
that of a leaf, into which the larva of some minute insect had
burrowed.&nbsp; But my son Francis, after making and examining
sections, could nowhere find that the cell-walls had been broken
down or that the epidermis had been penetrated.&nbsp; When the
section passed through the whitish dots, the grains of
chlorophyll were seen to be more or less discoloured, and some of
the palisade and mesophyll cells contained nothing but broken
down granular matter.&nbsp; These effects must be attributed to
the transudation of the secretion through the epidermis into the
cells.</p>
<p>The secretion with which worms moisten leaves likewise acts on
the starch-granules within the cells.&nbsp; My son examined some
leaves of the ash and many of the lime, which had fallen off the
trees and had been partly dragged into worm-burrows.&nbsp; It is
known that with fallen leaves the starch-grains are preserved in
the guard-cells of the stomata.&nbsp; Now in several cases the
starch had partially or wholly disappeared from these cells, in
the parts which had been moistened by the secretion; while it was
still well preserved in the other parts of the same leaves.&nbsp;
Sometimes the starch was dissolved out of only one of the two
guard-cells.&nbsp; The nucleus in one case had disappeared,
together with the starch-granules.&nbsp; The mere burying of
lime-leaves in damp earth for nine days did not cause the
destruction of the starch-granules.&nbsp; On the other hand, the
immersion of fresh lime and cherry leaves for eighteen hours in
artificial pancreatic fluid, led to the dissolution of the
starch-granules in the guard-cells as well as in the other
cells.</p>
<p>From the secretion with which the leaves are moistened being
alkaline, and from its acting both on the starch-granules and on
the protoplasmic contents of the cells, we may infer that it
resembles in nature not saliva, <a name="citation40"></a><a
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a> but pancreatic
secretion; and we know from Fredericq that a secretion of this
kind is found in the intestines of worms.&nbsp; As the leaves
which are dragged into the burrows are often dry and shrivelled,
it is indispensable for their disintegration by the unarmed
mouths of worms that they should first be moistened and softened;
and fresh leaves, however soft and tender they may be, are
similarly treated, probably from habit.&nbsp; The result is that
they are partially digested before they are taken into the
alimentary canal.&nbsp; I am not aware of any other case of
extra-stomachal digestion having been recorded.&nbsp; The
boa-constrictor is said to bathe its prey with saliva, but this
is doubtful; and it is done solely for the sake of lubricating
its prey.&nbsp; Perhaps the nearest analogy may be found in such
plants as Drosera and Dion&aelig;a; for here animal matter is
digested and converted into peptone not within a stomach, but on
the surfaces of the leaves.</p>
<p><i>Calciferous Glands</i>.&mdash;These glands (see Fig. 1),
judging from their size and from their rich supply of
blood-vessels, must be of much importance to the animal.&nbsp;
But almost as many theories have been advanced on their use as
there have been observers.&nbsp; They consist of three pairs,
which in the common earth-worm debouch into the alimentary canal
in advance of the gizzard, but posteriorly to it in
Uroch&aelig;ta and some other genera. <a
name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"
class="citation">[41a]</a>&nbsp; The two posterior pairs are
formed by lamell&aelig;, which, according to Clapar&egrave;de,
are diverticula from the &oelig;sophagus. <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a>&nbsp; These lamell&aelig; are coated
with a pulpy cellular layer, with the outer cells lying free in
infinite numbers.&nbsp; If one of these glands is punctured and
squeezed, a quantity of white pulpy matter exudes, consisting of
these free cells.&nbsp; They are minute, and vary in diameter
from 2 to 6 <i>&mu;</i>.&nbsp; They contain in their centres a
little excessively fine granular matter; but they look so like
oil globules that Clapar&egrave;de and others at first treated
them with ether.&nbsp; This produces no effect; but they are
quickly dissolved with effervescence in acetic acid, and when
oxalate of ammonia is added to the solution a white precipitate
is thrown down.&nbsp; We may therefore conclude that they contain
carbonate of lime.&nbsp; If the cells are immersed in a very
little acid, they become more transparent, look like ghosts, and
are soon lost to view; but if much acid is added, they disappear
instantly.&nbsp; After a very large number have been dissolved, a
flocculent residue is left, which apparently consists of the
delicate ruptured cell-walls.&nbsp; In the two posterior pairs of
glands the carbonate of lime contained in the cells occasionally
aggregates into small rhombic crystals or into concretions, which
lie between the lamell&aelig;; but I have seen only one case, and
Clapar&egrave;de only a very few such cases.</p>
<p>The two anterior glands differ a little in shape from the four
posterior ones, by being more oval.&nbsp; They differ also
conspicuously in generally containing several small, or two or
three larger, or a single very large concretion of carbonate of
lime, as much as 1&frac12; mm. in diameter.&nbsp; When a gland
includes only a few very small concretions, or, as sometimes
happens, none at all, it is easily overlooked.&nbsp; The large
concretions are round or oval, and exteriorly almost
smooth.&nbsp; One was found which filled up not only the whole
gland, as is often the case, but its neck; so that it resembled
an olive-oil flask in shape.&nbsp; These concretions when broken
are seen to be more or less crystalline in structure.&nbsp; How
they escape from the gland is a marvel; but that they do escape
is certain, for they are often found in the gizzard, intestines,
and in the castings of worms, both with those kept in confinement
and those in a state of nature.</p>
<p>Clapar&egrave;de says very little about the structure of the
two anterior glands, and he supposes that the calcareous matter
of which the concretions are formed is derived from the four
posterior glands.&nbsp; But if an anterior gland which contains
only small concretions is placed in acetic acid and afterwards
dissected, or if sections are made of such a gland without being
treated with acid, lamell&aelig; like those in the posterior
glands and coated with cellular matter could be plainly seen,
together with a multitude of free calciferous cells readily
soluble in acetic acid.&nbsp; When a gland is completely filled
with a single large concretion, there are no free cells, as these
have been all consumed in forming the concretion.&nbsp; But if
such a concretion, or one of only moderately large size, is
dissolved in acid, much membranous matter is left, which appears
to consist of the remains of the formerly active
lamell&aelig;.&nbsp; After the formation and expulsion of a large
concretion, new lamell&aelig; must be developed in some
manner.&nbsp; In one section made by my son, the process had
apparently commenced, although the gland contained two rather
large concretions, for near the walls several cylindrical and
oval pipes were intersected, which were lined with cellular
matter and were quite filled with free calciferous cells.&nbsp; A
great enlargement in one direction of several oval pipes would
give rise to the lamell&aelig;.</p>
<p>Besides the free calciferous cells in which no nucleus was
visible, other and rather larger free cells were seen on three
occasions; and these contained a distinct nucleus and
nucleolus.&nbsp; They were only so far acted on by acetic acid
that the nucleus was thus rendered more distinct.&nbsp; A very
small concretion was removed from between two of the
lamell&aelig; within an anterior gland.&nbsp; It was imbedded in
pulpy cellular matter, with many free calciferous cells, together
with a multitude of the larger, free, nucleated cells, and these
latter cells were not acted on by acetic acid, while the former
were dissolved.&nbsp; From this and other such cases I am led to
suspect that the calciferous cells are developed from the larger
nucleated ones; but how this was effected was not
ascertained.</p>
<p>When an anterior gland contains several minute concretions,
some of these are generally angular or crystalline in outline,
while the greater number are rounded with an irregular
mulberry-like surface.&nbsp; Calciferous cells adhered to many
parts of these mulberry-like masses, and their gradual
disappearance could be traced while they still remained
attached.&nbsp; It was thus evident that the concretions are
formed from the lime contained within the free calciferous
cells.&nbsp; As the smaller concretions increase in size, they
come into contact and unite, thus enclosing the now functionless
lamell&aelig;; and by such steps the formation of the largest
concretions could be followed.&nbsp; Why the process regularly
takes place in the two anterior glands, and only rarely in the
four posterior glands, is quite unknown.&nbsp; Morren says that
these glands disappear during the winter; and I have seen some
instances of this fact, and others in which either the anterior
or posterior glands were at this season so shrunk and empty, that
they could be distinguished only with much difficulty.</p>
<p>With respect to the function of the calciferous glands, it is
probable that they primarily serve as organs of excretion, and
secondarily as an aid to digestion.&nbsp; Worms consume many
fallen leaves; and it is known that lime goes on accumulating in
leaves until they drop off the parent-plant, instead of being
re-absorbed into the stem or roots, like various other organic
and inorganic substances. <a name="citation46"></a><a
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a>&nbsp; The ashes of a
leaf of an acacia have been known to contain as much as 72 per
cent. of lime.&nbsp; Worms therefore would be liable to become
charged with this earth, unless there were some special means for
its excretion; and the calciferous glands are well adapted for
this purpose.&nbsp; The worms which live in mould close over the
chalk, often have their intestines filled with this substance,
and their castings are almost white.&nbsp; Here it is evident
that the supply of calcareous matter must be
super-abundant.&nbsp; Nevertheless with several worms collected
on such a site, the calciferous glands contained as many free
calciferous cells, and fully as many and large concretions, as
did the glands of worms which lived where there was little or no
lime; and this indicates that the lime is an excretion, and not a
secretion poured into the alimentary canal for some special
purpose.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the following considerations render it
highly probable that the carbonate of lime, which is excreted by
the glands, aids the digestive process under ordinary
circumstances.&nbsp; Leaves during their decay generate an
abundance of various kinds of acids, which have been grouped
together under the term of humus acids.&nbsp; We shall have to
recur to this subject in our fifth chapter, and I need here only
say that these acids act strongly on carbonate of lime.&nbsp; The
half-decayed leaves which are swallowed in such large quantities
by worms would, therefore, after they have been moistened and
triturated in the alimentary canal, be apt to produce such
acids.&nbsp; And in the case of several worms, the contents of
the alimentary canal were found to be plainly acid, as shown by
litmus paper.&nbsp; This acidity cannot be attributed to the
nature of the digestive fluid, for pancreatic fluid is alkaline;
and we have seen that the secretion which is poured out of the
mouths of worms for the sake of preparing the leaves for
consumption, is likewise alkaline.&nbsp; The acidity can hardly
be due to uric acid, as the contents of the upper part of the
intestine were often acid.&nbsp; In one case the contents of the
gizzard were slightly acid, those of the upper intestines being
more plainly acid.&nbsp; In another case the contents of the
pharynx were not acid, those of the gizzard doubtfully so, while
those of the intestine were distinctly acid at a distance of 5
cm. below the gizzard.&nbsp; Even with the higher herbivorous and
omnivorous animals, the contents of the large intestine are
acid.&nbsp; &ldquo;This, however, is not caused by any acid
secretion from the mucous membrane; the reaction of the
intestinal walls in the larger as in the small intestine is
alkaline.&nbsp; It must therefore arise from acid fermentations
going on in the contents themselves . . .&nbsp; In Carnivora the
contents of the coecum are said to be alkaline, and naturally the
amount of fermentation will depend largely on the nature of the
food.&rdquo; <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a></p>
<p>With worms not only the contents of the intestines, but their
ejected matter or the castings, are generally acid.&nbsp; Thirty
castings from different places were tested, and with three or
four exceptions were found to be acid; and the exceptions may
have been due to such castings not having been recently ejected;
for some which were at first acid, were on the following morning,
after being dried and again moistened, no longer acid; and this
probably resulted from the humus acids being, as is known to be
the case, easily decomposed.&nbsp; Five fresh castings from worms
which lived in mould close over the chalk, were of a whitish
colour and abounded with calcareous matter; and these were not in
the least acid.&nbsp; This shows how effectually carbonate of
lime neutralises the intestinal acids.&nbsp; When worms were kept
in pots filled with fine ferruginous sand, it was manifest that
the oxide of iron, with which the grains of silex were coated,
had been dissolved and removed from them in the castings.</p>
<p>The digestive fluid of worms resembles in its action, as
already stated, the pancreatic secretion of the higher animals;
and in these latter, &ldquo;pancreatic digestion is essentially
alkaline; the action will not take place unless some alkali be
present; and the activity of an alkaline juice is arrested by
acidification, and hindered by neutralization.&rdquo; <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; Therefore it seems highly
probable that the innumerable calciferous cells, which are poured
from the four posterior glands into the alimentary canal of
worms, serve to neutralise more or less completely the acids
there generated by the half-decayed leaves.&nbsp; We have seen
that these cells are instantly dissolved by a small quantity of
acetic acid, and as they do not always suffice to neutralise the
contents of even the upper part of the alimentary canal, the lime
is perhaps aggregated into concretions in the anterior pair of
glands, in order that some may be carried down to the posterior
parts of the intestine, where these concretions would be rolled
about amongst the acid contents.&nbsp; The concretions found in
the intestines and in the castings often have a worn appearance,
but whether this is due to some amount of attrition or of
chemical corrosion could not be told.&nbsp; Clapar&egrave;de
believes that they are formed for the sake of acting as
mill-stones, and of thus aiding in the trituration of the
food.&nbsp; They may give some aid in this way; but I fully agree
with Perrier that this must be of quite subordinate importance,
seeing that the object is already attained by stones being
generally present in the gizzards and intestines of worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the pots in which worms were
kept, leaves were pinned down to the soil, and at night the
manner in which they were seized could be observed.&nbsp; The
worms always endeavoured to drag the leaves towards their
burrows; and they tore or sucked off small fragments, whenever
the leaves were sufficiently tender.&nbsp; They generally seized
the thin edge of a leaf with their mouths, between the projecting
upper and lower lip; the thick and strong pharynx being at the
same time, as Perrier remarks, pushed forward within their
bodies, so as to afford a point of resistance for the upper
lip.&nbsp; In the case of broad flat objects they acted in a
wholly different manner.&nbsp; The pointed anterior extremity of
the body, after being brought into contact with an object of this
kind, was drawn within the adjoining rings, so that it appeared
truncated and became as thick as the rest of the body.&nbsp; This
part could then be seen to swell a little; and this, I believe,
is due to the pharynx being pushed a little forwards.&nbsp; Then
by a slight withdrawal of the pharynx or by its expansion, a
vacuum was produced beneath the truncated slimy end of the body
whilst in contact with the object; and by this means the two
adhered firmly together. <a name="citation53"></a><a
href="#footnote53" class="citation">[53]</a>&nbsp; That under
these circumstances a vacuum was produced was plainly seen on one
occasion, when a large worm lying beneath a flaccid cabbage leaf
tried to drag it away; for the surface of the leaf directly over
the end of the worm&rsquo;s body became deeply pitted.&nbsp; On
another occasion a worm suddenly lost its hold on a flat leaf;
and the anterior end of the body was momentarily seen to be
cup-formed.&nbsp; Worms can attach themselves to an object
beneath water in the same manner; and I saw one thus dragging
away a submerged slice of an onion-bulb.</p>
<p>The edges of fresh or nearly fresh leaves affixed to the
ground were often nibbled by the worms; and sometimes the
epidermis and all the parenchyma on one side was gnawed
completely away over a considerable space; the epidermis alone on
the opposite side being left quite clean.&nbsp; The veins were
never touched, and leaves were thus sometimes partly converted
into skeletons.&nbsp; As worms have no teeth and as their mouths
consist of very soft tissue, it may be presumed that they consume
by means of suction the edges and the parenchyma of fresh leaves,
after they have been softened by the digestive fluid.&nbsp; They
cannot attack such strong leaves as those of sea-kale or large
and thick leaves of ivy; though one of the latter after it had
become rotten was reduced in parts to the state of a
skeleton.</p>
<p>Worms seize leaves and other objects, not only to serve as
food, but for plugging up the mouths of their burrows; and this
is one of their strongest instincts.&nbsp; They sometimes work so
energetically that Mr. D. F. Simpson, who has a small walled
garden where worms abound in Bayswater, informs me that on a calm
damp evening he there heard so extraordinary a rustling noise
from under a tree from which many leaves had fallen, that he went
out with a light and discovered that the noise was caused by many
worms dragging the dry leaves and squeezing them into the
burrows.&nbsp; Not only leaves, but petioles of many kinds, some
flower-peduncles, often decayed twigs of trees, bits of paper,
feathers, tufts of wool and horse-hairs are dragged into their
burrows for this purpose.&nbsp; I have seen as many as seventeen
petioles of a Clematis projecting from the mouth of one burrow,
and ten from the mouth of another.&nbsp; Some of these objects,
such as the petioles just named, feathers, &amp;c., are never
gnawed by worms.&nbsp; In a gravel-walk in my garden I found many
hundred leaves of a pine-tree (<i>P. austriaca</i> or
<i>nigricans</i>) drawn by their bases into burrows.&nbsp; The
surfaces by which these leaves are articulated to the branches
are shaped in as peculiar a manner as is the joint between the
leg-bones of a quadruped; and if these surfaces had been in the
least gnawed, the fact would have been immediately visible, but
there was no trace of gnawing.&nbsp; Of ordinary dicotyledonous
leaves, all those which are dragged into burrows are not
gnawed.&nbsp; I have seen as many as nine leaves of the lime-tree
drawn into the same burrow, and not nearly all of them had been
gnawed; but such leaves may serve as a store for future
consumption.&nbsp; Where fallen leaves are abundant, many more
are sometimes collected over the mouth of a burrow than can be
used, so that a small pile of unused leaves is left like a roof
over those which have been partly dragged in.</p>
<p>A leaf in being dragged a little way into a cylindrical burrow
is necessarily much folded or crumpled.&nbsp; When another leaf
is drawn in, this is done exteriorly to the first one, and so on
with the succeeding leaves; and finally all become closely folded
and pressed together.&nbsp; Sometimes the worm enlarges the mouth
of its burrow, or makes a fresh one close by, so as to draw in a
still larger number of leaves.&nbsp; They often or generally fill
up the interstices between the drawn-in leaves with moist viscid
earth ejected from their bodies; and thus the mouths of the
burrows are securely plugged.&nbsp; Hundreds of such plugged
burrows may be seen in many places, especially during the
autumnal and early winter months.&nbsp; But, as will hereafter be
shown, leaves are dragged into the burrows not only for plugging
them up and for food, but for the sake of lining the upper part
or mouth.</p>
<p>When worms cannot obtain leaves, petioles, sticks, &amp;c.,
with which to plug up the mouths of their burrows, they often
protect them by little heaps of stones; and such heaps of smooth
rounded pebbles may frequently be seen on gravel-walks.&nbsp;
Here there can be no question about food.&nbsp; A lady, who was
interested in the habits of worms, removed the little heaps of
stones from the mouths of several burrows and cleared the surface
of the ground for some inches all round.&nbsp; She went out on
the following night with a lantern, and saw the worms with their
tails fixed in their burrows, dragging the stones inwards by the
aid of their mouths, no doubt by suction.&nbsp; &ldquo;After two
nights some of the holes had 8 or 9 small stones over them; after
four nights one had about 30, and another 34 stones.&rdquo; <a
name="citation58"></a><a href="#footnote58"
class="citation">[58]</a>&nbsp; One stone&mdash;which had been
dragged over the gravel-walk to the mouth of a burrow weighed two
ounces; and this proves how strong worms are.&nbsp; But they show
greater strength in sometimes displacing stones in a well-trodden
gravel-walk; that they do so, may be inferred from the cavities
left by the displaced stones being exactly filled by those lying
over the mouths of adjoining burrows, as I have myself
observed.</p>
<p>Work of this kind is usually performed during the night; but I
have occasionally known objects to be drawn into the burrows
during the day.&nbsp; What advantage the worms derive from
plugging up the mouths of their burrows with leaves, &amp;c., or
from piling stones over them, is doubtful.&nbsp; They do not act
in this manner at the times when they eject much earth from their
burrows; for their castings then serve to cover the mouths.&nbsp;
When gardeners wish to kill worms on a lawn, it is necessary
first to brush or rake away the castings from the surface, in
order that the lime-water may enter the burrows. <a
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; It might be inferred from this
fact that the mouths are plugged up with leaves, &amp;c., to
prevent the entrance of water during heavy rain; but it may be
urged against this view that a few, loose, well-rounded stones
are ill-adapted to keep out water.&nbsp; I have moreover seen
many burrows in the perpendicularly cut turf-edgings to
gravel-walks, into which water could hardly flow, as well plugged
as burrows on a level surface.&nbsp; It is not probable that the
plugs or piles of stones serve to conceal the burrows from
scolopendras, which, according to Hoffmeister, <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a> are the bitterest enemies of worms, or
from the larger species of Carabus and Staphylinus which attack
them ferociously, for these animals are nocturnal, and the
burrows are opened at night.&nbsp; May not worms when the mouth
of the burrow is protected be able to remain with safety with
their heads close to it, which we know that they like to do, but
which costs so many of them their lives?&nbsp; Or may not the
plugs check the free ingress of the lowest stratum of air, when
chilled by radiation at night, from the surrounding ground and
herbage?&nbsp; I am inclined to believe in this latter view:
firstly, because when worms were kept in pots in a room with a
fire, in which case cold air could not enter the burrows, they
plugged them up in a slovenly manner; and secondarily, because
they often coat the upper part of their burrows with leaves,
apparently to prevent their bodies from coming into close contact
with the cold damp earth.&nbsp; Mr. E. Parfitt has suggested to
me that the mouths of the burrows are closed in order that the
air within them may be kept thoroughly damp, and this seems the
most probable explanation of the habit.&nbsp; But the plugging-up
process may serve for all the above purposes.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive may be, it appears that worms much dislike
leaving the mouths of their burrows open.&nbsp; Nevertheless they
will reopen them at night, whether or not they can afterwards
close them.&nbsp; Numerous open burrows may be seen on
recently-dug ground, for in this case the worms eject their
castings in cavities left in the ground, or in the old burrows
instead of piling them over the mouths of their burrows, and they
cannot collect objects on the surface by which the mouths might
be protected.&nbsp; So again on a recently disinterred pavement
of a Roman villa at Abinger (hereafter to be described) the worms
pertinaciously opened their burrows almost every night, when
these had been closed by being trampled on, although they were
rarely able to find a few minute stones wherewith to protect
them.</p>
<p><i>Intelligence shown by worms in their manner of plugging up
their burrows</i>.&mdash;If a man had to plug up a small
cylindrical hole, with such objects as leaves, petioles or twigs,
he would drag or push them in by their pointed ends; but if these
objects were very thin relatively to the size of the hole, he
would probably insert some by their thicker or broader
ends.&nbsp; The guide in his case would be intelligence.&nbsp; It
seemed therefore worth while to observe carefully how worms
dragged leaves into their burrows; whether by their tips or bases
or middle parts.&nbsp; It seemed more especially desirable to do
this in the case of plants not natives to our country; for
although the habit of dragging leaves into their burrows is
undoubtedly instinctive with worms, yet instinct could not tell
them how to act in the case of leaves about which their
progenitors knew nothing.&nbsp; If, moreover, worms acted solely
through instinct or an unvarying inherited impulse, they would
draw all kinds of leaves into their burrows in the same
manner.&nbsp; If they have no such definite instinct, we might
expect that chance would determine whether the tip, base or
middle was seized.&nbsp; If both these alternatives are excluded,
intelligence alone is left; unless the worm in each case first
tries many different methods, and follows that alone which proves
possible or the most easy; but to act in this manner and to try
different methods makes a near approach to intelligence.</p>
<p>In the first place 227 withered leaves of various kinds,
mostly of English plants, were pulled out of worm-burrows in
several places.&nbsp; Of these, 181 had been drawn into the
burrows by or near their tips, so that the foot-stalk projected
nearly upright from the mouth of the burrow; 20 had been drawn in
by their bases, and in this case the tips projected from the
burrows; and 26 had been seized near the middle, so that these
had been drawn in transversely and were much crumpled.&nbsp;
Therefore 80 per cent. (always using the nearest whole number)
had been drawn in by the tip, 9 per cent. by the base or
foot-stalk, and 11 per cent. transversely or by the middle.&nbsp;
This alone is almost sufficient to show that chance does not
determine the manner in which leaves are dragged into the
burrows.</p>
<p>Of the above 227 leaves, 70 consisted of the fallen leaves of
the common lime-tree, which is almost certainly not a native of
England.&nbsp; These leaves are much acuminated towards the tip,
and are very broad at the base with a well-developed
foot-stalk.&nbsp; They are thin and quite flexible when
half-withered.&nbsp; Of the 70, 79 per cent. had been drawn in by
or near the tip; 4 per cent. by or near the base; and 17 per
cent. transversely or by the middle.&nbsp; These proportions
agree very closely, as far as the tip is concerned, with those
before given.&nbsp; But the percentage drawn in by the base is
smaller, which may be attributed to the breadth of the basal part
of the blade.&nbsp; We here, also, see that the presence of a
foot-stalk, which it might have been expected would have tempted
the worms as a convenient handle, has little or no influence in
determining the manner in which lime leaves are dragged into the
burrows.&nbsp; The considerable proportion, viz., 17 per cent.,
drawn in more or less transversely depends no doubt on the
flexibility of these half-decayed leaves.&nbsp; The fact of so
many having been drawn in by the middle, and of some few having
been drawn in by the base, renders it improbable that the worms
first tried to draw in most of the leaves by one or both of these
methods, and that they afterwards drew in 79 per cent. by their
tips; for it is clear that they would not have failed in drawing
them in by the base or middle.</p>
<p>The leaves of a foreign plant were next searched for, the
blades of which were not more pointed towards the apex than
towards the base.&nbsp; This proved to be the case with those of
a laburnum (a hybrid between <i>Cytisus alpinus</i> and
<i>laburnum</i>) for on doubling the terminal over the basal
half, they generally fitted exactly; and when there was any
difference, the basal half was a little the narrower.&nbsp; It
might, therefore, have been expected that an almost equal number
of these leaves would have been drawn in by the tip and base, or
a slight excess in favour of the latter.&nbsp; But of 73 leaves
(not included in the first lot of 227) pulled out of
worm-burrows, 63 per cent. had been drawn in by the tip; 27 per
cent. by the base, and 10 per cent. transversely.&nbsp; We here
see that a far larger proportion, viz., 27 per cent. were drawn
in by the base than in the case of lime leaves, the blades of
which are very broad at the base, and of which only 4 per cent.
had thus been drawn in.&nbsp; We may perhaps account for the fact
of a still larger proportion of the laburnum leaves not having
been drawn in by the base, by worms having acquired the habit of
generally drawing in leaves by their tips and thus avoiding the
foot-stalk.&nbsp; For the basal margin of the blade in many kinds
of leaves forms a large angle with the foot-stalk; and if such a
leaf were drawn in by the foot-stalk, the basal margin would come
abruptly into contact with the ground on each side of the burrow,
and would render the drawing in of the leaf very difficult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless worms break through their habit of avoiding the
foot-stalk, if this part offers them the most convenient means
for drawing leaves into their burrows.&nbsp; The leaves of the
endless hybridised varieties of the Rhododendron vary much in
shape; some are narrowest towards the base and others towards the
apex.&nbsp; After they have fallen off, the blade on each side of
the midrib often becomes curled up while drying, sometimes along
the whole length, sometimes chiefly at the base, sometimes
towards the apex.&nbsp; Out of 28 fallen leaves on one bed of
peat in my garden, no less than 23 were narrower in the basal
quarter than in the terminal quarter of their length; and this
narrowness was chiefly due to the curling in of the
margins.&nbsp; Out of 36 fallen leaves on another bed, in which
different varieties of the Rhododendron grew, only 17 were
narrower towards the base than towards the apex.&nbsp; My son
William, who first called my attention to this case, picked up
237 fallen leaves in his garden (where the Rhododendron grows in
the natural soil) and of these 65 per cent. could have been drawn
by worms into their burrows more easily by the base or foot-stalk
than by the tip; and this was partly due to the shape of the leaf
and in a less degree to the curling in of the margins: 27 per
cent. could have been drawn in more easily by the tip than by the
base: and 8 per cent. with about equal ease by either end.&nbsp;
The shape of a fallen leaf ought to be judged of before one end
has been drawn into a burrow, for after this has happened, the
free end, whether it be the base or apex, will dry more quickly
than the end imbedded in the damp ground; and the exposed margins
of the free end will consequently tend to become more curled
inwards than they were when the leaf was first seized by the
worm.&nbsp; My son found 91 leaves which had been dragged by
worms into their burrows, though not to a great depth; of these
66 per cent. had been drawn in by the base or foot-stalk; and 34
per cent. by the tip.&nbsp; In this case, therefore, the worms
judged with a considerable degree of correctness how best to draw
the withered leaves of this foreign plant into their burrows;
notwithstanding that they had to depart from their usual habit of
avoiding the foot-stalk.</p>
<p>On the gravel-walks in my garden a very large number of leaves
of three species of Pinus (<i>P. austriaca</i>, <i>nigricans</i>
and <i>sylvestris</i>) are regularly drawn into the mouths of
worm burrows.&nbsp; These leaves consist of two so-called
needles, which are of considerable length in the two first and
short in the last named species, and are united to a common base;
and it is by this part that they are almost invariably drawn into
the burrows.&nbsp; I have seen only two or at most three
exceptions to this rule with worms in a state of nature.&nbsp; As
the sharply pointed needles diverge a little, and as several
leaves are drawn into the same burrow, each tuft forms a perfect
<i>chevaux de frise</i>.&nbsp; On two occasions many of these
tufts were pulled up in the evening, but by the following morning
fresh leaves had been pulled in, and the burrows were again well
protected.&nbsp; These leaves could not be dragged into the
burrows to any depth, except by their bases, as a worm cannot
seize hold of the two needles at the same time, and if one alone
were seized by the apex, the other would be pressed against the
ground and would resist the entry of the seized one.&nbsp; This
was manifest in the above mentioned two or three exceptional
cases.&nbsp; In order, therefore, that worms should do their work
well, they must drag pine-leaves into their burrows by their
bases, where the two needles are conjoined.&nbsp; But how they
are guided in this work is a perplexing question.</p>
<p>This difficulty led my son Francis and myself to observe worms
in confinement during several nights by the aid of a dim light,
while they dragged the leaves of the above named pines into their
burrows.&nbsp; They moved the anterior extremities of their
bodies about the leaves, and on several occasions when they
touched the sharp end of a needle they withdrew suddenly as if
pricked.&nbsp; But I doubt whether they were hurt, for they are
indifferent to very sharp objects, and will swallow even
rose-thorns and small splinters of glass.&nbsp; It may also be
doubted, whether the sharp ends of the needles serve to tell them
that this is the wrong end to seize; for the points were cut off
many leaves for a length of about one inch, and fifty-seven of
them thus treated were drawn into the burrows by their bases, and
not one by the cut-off ends.&nbsp; The worms in confinement often
seized the needles near the middle and drew them towards the
mouths of their burrows; and one worm tried in a senseless manner
to drag them into the burrow by bending them.&nbsp; They
sometimes collected many more leaves over the mouths of their
burrows (as in the case formerly mentioned of lime-leaves) than
could enter them.&nbsp; On other occasions, however, they behaved
very differently; for as soon as they touched the base of a
pine-leaf, this was seized, being sometimes completely engulfed
in their mouths, or a point very near the base was seized, and
the leaf was then quickly dragged or rather jerked into their
burrows.&nbsp; It appeared both to my son and myself as if the
worms instantly perceived as soon as they had seized a leaf in
the proper manner.&nbsp; Nine such cases were observed, but in
one of them the worm failed to drag the leaf into its burrow, as
it was entangled by other leaves lying near.&nbsp; In another
case a leaf stood nearly upright with the points of the needles
partly inserted into a burrow, but how placed there was not seen;
and then the worm reared itself up and seized the base, which was
dragged into the mouth of the burrow by bowing the whole
leaf.&nbsp; On the other hand, after a worm had seized the base
of a leaf, this was on two occasions relinquished from some
unknown motive.</p>
<p>As already remarked, the habit of plugging up the mouths of
the burrows with various objects, is no doubt instinctive in
worms; and a very young one, born in one of my pots, dragged for
some little distance a Scotch-fir leaf, one needle of which was
as long and almost as thick as its own body.&nbsp; No species of
pine is endemic in this part of England, it is therefore
incredible that the proper manner of dragging pine-leaves into
the burrows can be instinctive with our worms.&nbsp; But as the
worms on which the above observations were made, were dug up
beneath or near some pines, which had been planted there about
forty years, it was desirable to prove that their actions were
not instinctive.&nbsp; Accordingly, pine-leaves were scattered on
the ground in places far removed from any pine-tree, and 90 of
them were drawn into the burrows by their bases.&nbsp; Only two
were drawn in by the tips of the needles, and these were not real
exceptions, as one was drawn in for a very short distance, and
the two needles of the other cohered.&nbsp; Other pine-leaves
were given to worms kept in pots in a warm room, and here the
result was different; for out of 42 leaves drawn into the
burrows, no less than 16 were drawn in by the tips of the
needles.&nbsp; These worms, however, worked in a careless or
slovenly manner; for the leaves were often drawn in to only a
small depth; sometimes they were merely heaped over the mouths of
the burrows, and sometimes none were drawn in.&nbsp; I believe
that this carelessness may be accounted for either by the warmth
of the air, or by its dampness, as the pots were covered by glass
plates; the worms consequently did not care about plugging up
their holes effectually.&nbsp; Pots tenanted by worms and covered
with a net which allowed the free entrance of air, were left out
of doors for several nights, and now 72 leaves were all properly
drawn in by their bases.</p>
<p>It might perhaps be inferred from the facts as yet given, that
worms somehow gain a general notion of the shape or structure of
pine-leaves, and perceive that it is necessary for them to seize
the base where the two needles are conjoined.&nbsp; But the
following cases make this more than doubtful.&nbsp; The tips of a
large number of needles of <i>P. austriaca</i> were cemented
together with shell-lac dissolved in alcohol, and were kept for
some days, until, as I believe, all odour or taste had been lost;
and they were then scattered on the ground where no pine-trees
grew, near burrows from which the plugging had been
removed.&nbsp; Such leaves could have been drawn into the burrows
with equal ease by either end; and judging from analogy and more
especially from the case presently to be given of the petioles of
<i>Clematis montana</i>, I expected that the apex would have been
preferred.&nbsp; But the result was that out of 121 leaves with
the tips cemented, which were drawn into burrows, 108 were drawn
in by their bases, and only 13 by their tips.&nbsp; Thinking that
the worms might possibly perceive and dislike the smell or taste
of the shell-lac, though this was very improbable, especially
after the leaves had been left out during several nights, the
tips of the needles of many leaves were tied together with fine
thread.&nbsp; Of leaves thus treated 150 were drawn into
burrows&mdash;123 by the base and 27 by the tied tips; so that
between four and five times as many were drawn in by the base as
by the tip.&nbsp; It is possible that the short cut-off ends of
the thread with which they were tied, may have tempted the worms
to drag in a larger proportional number by the tips than when
cement was used.&nbsp; Of the leaves with tied and cemented tips
taken together (271 in number) 85 per cent. were drawn in by the
base and 15 per cent. by the tips.&nbsp; We may therefore infer
that it is not the divergence of the two needles which leads
worms in a state of nature almost invariably to drag pine-leaves
into their burrows by the base.&nbsp; Nor can it be the sharpness
of the points of the needles which determines them; for, as we
have seen, many leaves with the points cut off were drawn in by
their bases.&nbsp; We are thus led to conclude, that with
pine-leaves there must be something attractive to worms in the
base, notwithstanding that few ordinary leaves are drawn in by
the base or foot-stalk.</p>
<p><i>Petioles</i>.&mdash;We will now turn to the petioles or
foot-stalks of compound leaves, after the leaflets have fallen
off.&nbsp; Those from <i>Clematis montana</i>, which grew over a
verandah, were dragged early in January in large numbers into the
burrows on an adjoining gravel-walk, lawn, and flower-bed.&nbsp;
These petioles vary from 2&frac12; to 4&frac12; inches in length,
are rigid and of nearly uniform thickness, except close to the
base where they thicken rather abruptly, being here about twice
as thick as in any other part.&nbsp; The apex is somewhat
pointed, but soon withers and is then easily broken off.&nbsp; Of
these petioles, 314 were pulled out of burrows in the above
specified sites; and it was found that 76 per cent. had been
drawn in by their tips, and 24 per cent by their bases; so that
those drawn in by the tip were a little more than thrice as many
as those drawn in by the base.&nbsp; Some of those extracted from
the well-beaten gravel-walk were kept separate from the others;
and of these (59 in number) nearly five times as many had been
drawn in by the tip as by the base; whereas of those extracted
from the lawn and flower-bed, where from the soil yielding more
easily, less care would be necessary in plugging up the burrows,
the proportion of those drawn in by the tip (130) to those drawn
in by the base (48) was rather less than three to one.&nbsp; That
these petioles had been dragged into the burrows for plugging
them up, and not for food, was manifest, as neither end, as far
as I could see, had been gnawed.&nbsp; As several petioles are
used to plug up the same burrow, in one case as many as 10, and
in another case as many as 15, the worms may perhaps at first
draw in a few by the thicker end so as to save labour; but
afterwards a large majority are drawn in by the pointed end, in
order to plug up the hole securely.</p>
<p>The fallen petioles of our native ash-tree were next observed,
and the rule with most objects, viz., that a large majority are
dragged into the burrows by the more pointed end, had not here
been followed; and this fact much surprised me at first.&nbsp;
These petioles vary in length from 5 to 8&frac12; inches; they
are thick and fleshy towards the base, whence they taper gently
towards the apex, which is a little enlarged and truncated where
the terminal leaflet had been originally attached.&nbsp; Under
some ash-trees growing in a grass-field, 229 petioles were pulled
out of worm burrows early in January, and of these 51.5 per cent.
had been drawn in by the base, and 48.5 per cent. by the
apex.&nbsp; This anomaly was however readily explained as soon as
the thick basal part was examined; for in 78 out of 103 petioles,
this part had been gnawed by worms, just above the horse-shoe
shaped articulation.&nbsp; In most cases there could be no
mistake about the gnawing; for ungnawed petioles which were
examined after being exposed to the weather for eight additional
weeks had not become more disintegrated or decayed near the base
than elsewhere.&nbsp; It is thus evident that the thick basal end
of the petiole is drawn in not solely for the sake of plugging up
the mouths of the burrows, but as food.&nbsp; Even the narrow
truncated tips of some few petioles had been gnawed; and this was
the case in 6 out of 37 which were examined for this
purpose.&nbsp; Worms, after having drawn in and gnawed the basal
end, often push the petioles out of their burrows; and then drag
in fresh ones, either by the base for food, or by the apex for
plugging up the mouth more effectually.&nbsp; Thus, out of 37
petioles inserted by their tips, 5 had been previously drawn in
by the base, for this part had been gnawed.&nbsp; Again, I
collected a handful of petioles lying loose on the ground close
to some plugged-up burrows, where the surface was thickly strewed
with other petioles which apparently had never been touched by
worms; and 14 out of 47 (<i>i.e.</i> nearly one-third), after
having had their bases gnawed had been pushed out of the burrows
and were now lying on the ground.&nbsp; From these several facts
we may conclude that worms draw in some petioles of the ash by
the base to serve as food, and others by the tip to plug up the
mouths of their burrows in the most efficient manner.</p>
<p>The petioles of <i>Robinia pseudo-acacia</i> vary from 4 or 5
to nearly 12 inches in length; they are thick close to the base
before the softer parts have rotted off, and taper much towards
the upper end.&nbsp; They are so flexible that I have seen some
few doubled up and thus drawn into the burrows of worms.&nbsp;
Unfortunately these petioles were not examined until February, by
which time the softer parts had completely rotted off, so that it
was impossible to ascertain whether worms had gnawed the bases,
though this is in itself probable.&nbsp; Out of 121 petioles
extracted from burrows early in February, 68 were imbedded by the
base, and 53 by the apex.&nbsp; On February 5 all the petioles
which had been drawn into the burrows beneath a Robinia, were
pulled up; and after an interval of eleven days, 35 petioles had
been again dragged in, 19 by the base, and 16 by the apex.&nbsp;
Taking these two lots together, 56 per cent. were drawn in by the
base, and 44 per cent. by the apex.&nbsp; As all the softer parts
had long ago rotted off, we may feel sure, especially in the
latter case, that none had been drawn in as food.&nbsp; At this
season, therefore, worms drag these petioles into their burrows
indifferently by either end, a slight preference being given to
the base.&nbsp; This latter fact may be accounted for by the
difficulty of plugging up a burrow with objects so extremely thin
as are the upper ends.&nbsp; In support of this view, it may be
stated that out of the 16 petioles which had been drawn in by
their upper ends, the more attenuated terminal portion of 7 had
been previously broken off by some accident.</p>
<p><i>Triangles of paper</i>.&mdash;Elongated triangles were cut
out of moderately stiff writing-paper, which was rubbed with raw
fat on both sides, so as to prevent their becoming excessively
limp when exposed at night to rain and dew.&nbsp; The sides of
all the triangles were three inches in length, with the bases of
120 one inch, and of the other 183 half an inch in length.&nbsp;
These latter triangles were very narrow or much acuminated. <a
name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a>&nbsp; As a check on the observations
presently to be given, similar triangles in a damp state were
seized by a very narrow pair of pincers at different points and
at all inclinations with reference to the margins, and were then
drawn into a short tube of the diameter of a worm-burrow.&nbsp;
If seized by the apex, the triangle was drawn straight into the
tube, with its margins infolded; if seized at some little
distance from the apex, for instance at half an inch, this much
was doubled back within the tube.&nbsp; So it was with the base
and basal angles, though in this case the triangles offered, as
might have been expected, much more resistance to being drawn
in.&nbsp; If seized near the middle the triangle was doubled up,
with the apex and base left sticking out of the tube.&nbsp; As
the sides of the triangles were three inches in length, the
result of their being drawn into a tube or into a burrow in
different ways, may be conveniently divided into three groups:
those drawn in by the apex or within an inch of it; those drawn
in by the base or within an inch of it; and those drawn in by any
point in the middle inch.</p>
<p>In order to see how the triangles would be seized by worms,
some in a damp state were given to worms kept in
confinement.&nbsp; They were seized in three different manners in
the case of both the narrow and broad triangles: viz., by the
margin; by one of the three angles, which was often completely
engulfed in their mouths; and lastly, by suction applied to any
part of the flat surface.&nbsp; If lines parallel to the base and
an inch apart, are drawn across a triangle with the sides three
inches in length, it will be divided into three parts of equal
length.&nbsp; Now if worms seized indifferently by chance any
part, they would assuredly seize on the basal part or division
far oftener than on either of the two other divisions.&nbsp; For
the area of the basal to the apical part is as 5 to 1, so that
the chance of the former being drawn into a burrow by suction,
will be as 5 to 1, compared with the apical part.&nbsp; The base
offers two angles and the apex only one, so that the former would
have twice as good a chance (independently of the size of the
angles) of being engulfed in a worm&rsquo;s mouth, as would the
apex.&nbsp; It should, however, be stated that the apical angle
is not often seized by worms; the margin at a little distance on
either side being preferred.&nbsp; I judge of this from having
found in 40 out of 46 cases in which triangles had been drawn
into burrows by their apical ends, that the tip had been doubled
back within the burrow for a length of between 1/20 of an inch
and 1 inch.&nbsp; Lastly, the proportion between the margins of
the basal and apical parts is as 3 to 2 for the broad, and
2&frac12; to 2 for the narrow triangles.&nbsp; From these several
considerations it might certainly have been expected, supposing
that worms seized hold of the triangles by chance, that a
considerably larger proportion would have been dragged into the
burrows by the basal than by the apical part; but we shall
immediately see how different was the result.</p>
<p>Triangles of the above specified sizes were scattered on the
ground in many places and on many successive nights near
worm-burrows, from which the leaves, petioles, twigs, &amp;c.,
with which they had been plugged, were removed.&nbsp; Altogether
303 triangles were drawn by worms into their burrows: 12 others
were drawn in by both ends, but as it was impossible to judge by
which end they had been first seized, these are excluded.&nbsp;
Of the 303, 62 per cent. had been drawn in by the apex (using
this term for all drawn in by the apical part, one inch in
length); 15 per cent. by the middle; and 23 per cent. by the
basal part.&nbsp; If they had been drawn indifferently by any
point, the proportion for the apical, middle and basal parts
would have been 33.3 per cent. for each; but, as we have just
seen, it might have been expected that a much larger proportion
would have been drawn in by the basal than by any other
part.&nbsp; As the case stands, nearly three times as many were
drawn in by the apex as by the base.&nbsp; If we consider the
broad triangles by themselves, 59 per cent. were drawn in by the
apex, 25 per cent. by the middle, and 16 per cent. by the
base.&nbsp; Of the narrow triangles, 65 per cent. were drawn in
by the apex, 14 per cent, by the middle, and 21 per cent. by the
base; so that here those drawn in by the apex were more than 3
times as many as those drawn in by the base.&nbsp; We may
therefore conclude that the manner in which the triangles are
drawn into the burrows is not a matter of chance.</p>
<p>In eight cases, two triangles had been drawn into the same
burrow, and in seven of these cases, one had been drawn in by the
apex and the other by the base.&nbsp; This again indicates that
the result is not determined by chance.&nbsp; Worms appear
sometimes to revolve in the act of drawing in the triangles, for
five out of the whole lot had been wound into an irregular spire
round the inside of the burrow.&nbsp; Worms kept in a warm room
drew 63 triangles into their burrows; but, as in the case of the
pine-leaves, they worked in a rather careless manner, for only 44
per cent. were drawn in by the apex, 22 per cent. by the middle,
and 33 per cent. by the base.&nbsp; In five cases, two triangles
were drawn into the same burrow.</p>
<p>It may be suggested with much apparent probability that so
large a proportion of the triangles were drawn in by the apex,
not from the worms having selected this end as the most
convenient for the purpose, but from having first tried in other
ways and failed.&nbsp; This notion was countenanced by the manner
in which worms in confinement were seen to drag about and drop
the triangles; but then they were working carelessly.&nbsp; I did
not at first perceive the importance of this subject, but merely
noticed that the bases of those triangles which had been drawn in
by the apex, were generally clean and not crumpled.&nbsp; The
subject was afterwards attended to carefully.&nbsp; In the first
place several triangles which had been drawn in by the basal
angles, or by the base, or a little above the base, and which
were thus much crumpled and dirtied, were left for some hours in
water and were then well shaken while immersed; but neither the
dirt nor the creases were thus removed.&nbsp; Only slight creases
could be obliterated, even by pulling the wet triangles several
times through my fingers.&nbsp; Owing to the slime from the
worms&rsquo; bodies, the dirt was not easily washed off.&nbsp; We
may therefore conclude that if a triangle, before being dragged
in by the apex, had been dragged into a burrow by its base with
even a slight degree of force, the basal part would long retain
its creases and remain dirty.&nbsp; The condition of 89 triangles
(65 narrow and 24 broad ones), which had been drawn in by the
apex, was observed; and the bases of only 7 of them were at all
creased, being at the same time generally dirty.&nbsp; Of the 82
uncreased triangles, 14 were dirty at the base; but it does not
follow from this fact that these had first been dragged towards
the burrows by their bases; for the worms sometimes covered large
portions of the triangles with slime, and these when dragged by
the apex over the ground would be dirtied; and during rainy
weather, the triangles were often dirtied over one whole side or
over both sides.&nbsp; If the worms had dragged the triangles to
the mouths of their burrows by their bases, as often as by their
apices, and had then perceived, without actually trying to draw
them into the burrow, that the broader end was not well adapted
for this purpose&mdash;even in this case a large proportion would
probably have had their basal ends dirtied.&nbsp; We may
therefore infer&mdash;improbable as is the inference&mdash;that
worms are able by some means to judge which is the best end by
which to draw triangles of paper into their burrows.</p>
<p>The percentage results of the foregoing observations on the
manner in which worms draw various kinds of objects into the
mouths of their burrows may be abridged as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>If we consider these several cases, we can hardly escape from
the conclusion that worms show some degree of intelligence in
their manner of plugging up their burrows.&nbsp; Each particular
object is seized in too uniform a manner, and from causes which
we can generally understand, for the result to be attributed to
mere chance.&nbsp; That every object has not been drawn in by its
pointed end, may be accounted for by labour having been saved
through some being inserted by their broader or thicker
ends.&nbsp; No doubt worms are led by instinct to plug up their
burrows; and it might have been expected that they would have
been led by instinct how best to act in each particular case,
independently of intelligence.&nbsp; We see how difficult it is
to judge whether intelligence comes into play, for even plants
might sometimes be thought to be thus directed; for instance when
displaced leaves re-direct their upper surfaces towards the light
by extremely complicated movements and by the shortest
course.&nbsp; With animals, actions appearing due to intelligence
may be performed through inherited habit without any
intelligence, although aboriginally thus acquired.&nbsp; Or the
habit may have been acquired through the preservation and
inheritance of beneficial variations of some other habit; and in
this case the new habit will have been acquired independently of
intelligence throughout the whole course of its
development.&nbsp; There is no <i>&agrave; priori</i>
improbability in worms having acquired special instincts through
either of these two latter means.&nbsp; Nevertheless it is
incredible that instincts should have been developed in reference
to objects, such as the leaves of petioles of foreign plants,
wholly unknown to the progenitors of the worms which act in the
described manner.&nbsp; Nor are their actions so unvarying or
inevitable as are most true instincts.</p>
<p>As worms are not guided by special instincts in each
particular case, though possessing a general instinct to plug up
their burrows, and as chance is excluded, the next most probable
conclusion seems to be that they try in many different ways to
draw in objects, and at last succeed in some one way.&nbsp; But
it is surprising that an animal so low in the scale as a worm
should have the capacity for acting in this manner, as many
higher animals have no such capacity.&nbsp; For instance, ants
may be seen vainly trying to drag an object transversely to their
course, which could be easily drawn longitudinally; though after
a time they generally act in a wiser manner, M. Fabre states <a
name="citation89a"></a><a href="#footnote89a"
class="citation">[89a]</a> that a Sphex&mdash;an insect belonging
to the same highly-endowed order with ants&mdash;stocks its nest
with paralysed grass-hoppers, which are invariably dragged into
the burrow by their antenn&aelig;.&nbsp; When these were cut off
close to the head, the Sphex seized the palpi; but when these
were likewise cut off, the attempt to drag its prey into the
burrow was given up in despair.&nbsp; The Sphex had not
intelligence enough to seize one of the six legs or the
ovipositor of the grasshopper, which, as M. Fabre remarks, would
have served equally well.&nbsp; So again, if the paralysed prey
with an egg attached to it be taken out of the cell, the Sphex
after entering and finding the cell empty, nevertheless closes it
up in the usual elaborate manner.&nbsp; Bees will try to escape
and go on buzzing for hours on a window, one half of which has
been left open.&nbsp; Even a pike continued during three months
to dash and bruise itself against the glass sides of an aquarium,
in the vain attempt to seize minnows on the opposite side. <a
name="citation89b"></a><a href="#footnote89b"
class="citation">[89b]</a>&nbsp; A cobra-snake was seen by Mr.
Layard <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> to act much more wisely than either the
pike or the Sphex; it had swallowed a toad lying within a hole,
and could not withdraw its head; the toad was disgorged, and
began to crawl away; it was again swallowed and again disgorged;
and now the snake had learnt by experience, for it seized the
toad by one of its legs and drew it out of the hole.&nbsp; The
instincts of even the higher animals are often followed in a
senseless or purposeless manner: the weaver-bird will
perseveringly wind threads through the bars of its cage, as if
building a nest: a squirrel will pat nuts on a wooden floor, as
if he had just buried them in the ground: a beaver will cut up
logs of wood and drag them about, though there is no water to dam
up; and so in many other cases.</p>
<p>Mr. Romanes, who has specially studied the minds of animals,
believes that we can safely infer intelligence, only when we see
an individual profiting by its own experience.&nbsp; By this test
the cobra showed some intelligence; but this would have been much
plainer if on a second occasion he had drawn a toad out of a hole
by its leg.&nbsp; The Sphex failed signally in this
respect.&nbsp; Now if worms try to drag objects into their
burrows first in one way and then in another, until they at last
succeed, they profit, at least in each particular instance, by
experience.</p>
<p>But evidence has been advanced showing that worms do not
habitually try to draw objects into their burrows in many
different ways.&nbsp; Thus half-decayed lime-leaves from their
flexibility could have been drawn in by their middle or basal
parts, and were thus drawn into the burrows in considerable
numbers; yet a large majority were drawn in by or near the
apex.&nbsp; The petioles of the Clematis could certainly have
been drawn in with equal ease by the base and apex; yet three
times and in certain cases five times as many were drawn in by
the apex as by the base.&nbsp; It might have been thought that
the foot-stalks of leaves would have tempted the worms as a
convenient handle; yet they are not largely used, except when the
base of the blade is narrower than the apex.&nbsp; A large number
of the petioles of the ash are drawn in by the base; but this
part serves the worms as food.&nbsp; In the case of pine-leaves
worms plainly show that they at least do not seize the leaf by
chance; but their choice does not appear to be determined by the
divergence of the two needles, and the consequent advantage or
necessity of drawing them into their burrows by the base.&nbsp;
With respect to the triangles of paper, those which had been
drawn in by the apex rarely had their bases creased or dirty; and
this shows that the worms had not often first tried to drag them
in by this end.</p>
<p>If worms are able to judge, either before drawing or after
having drawn an object close to the mouths of their burrows, how
best to drag it in, they must acquire some notion of its general
shape.&nbsp; This they probably acquire by touching it in many
places with the anterior extremity of their bodies, which serves
as a tactile organ.&nbsp; It may be well to remember how perfect
the sense of touch becomes in a man when born blind and deaf, as
are worms.&nbsp; If worms have the power of acquiring some
notion, however rude, of the shape of an object and of their
burrows, as seems to be the case, they deserve to be called
intelligent; for they then act in nearly the same manner as would
a man under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>To sum up, as chance does not determine the manner in which
objects are drawn into the burrows, and as the existence of
specialized instincts for each particular case cannot be
admitted, the first and most natural supposition is that worms
try all methods until they at last succeed; but many appearances
are opposed to such a supposition.&nbsp; One alternative alone is
left, namely, that worms, although standing low in the scale of
organization, possess some degree of intelligence.&nbsp; This
will strike every one as very improbable; but it may be doubted
whether we know enough about the nervous system of the lower
animals to justify our natural distrust of such a
conclusion.&nbsp; With respect to the small size of the cerebral
ganglia, we should remember what a mass of inherited knowledge,
with some power of adapting means to an end, is crowded into the
minute brain of a worker-ant.</p>
<p><i>Means by which worms excavate their burrows</i>.&mdash;This
is effected in two ways; by pushing away the earth on all sides,
and by swallowing it.&nbsp; In the former case, the worm inserts
the stretched out and attenuated anterior extremity of its body
into any little crevice, or hole; and then, as Perrier remarks,
<a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a> the pharynx is pushed forwards into
this part, which consequently swells and pushes away the earth on
all sides.&nbsp; The anterior extremity thus serves as a
wedge.&nbsp; It also serves, as we have before seen, for
prehension and suction, and as a tactile organ.&nbsp; A worm was
placed on loose mould, and it buried itself in between two and
three minutes.&nbsp; On another occasion four worms disappeared
in 15 minutes between the sides of the pot and the earth, which
had been moderately pressed down.&nbsp; On a third occasion three
large worms and a small one were placed on loose mould well mixed
with fine sand and firmly pressed down, and they all disappeared,
except the tail of one, in 35 minutes.&nbsp; On a fourth occasion
six large worms were placed on argillaceous mud mixed with sand
firmly pressed down, and they disappeared, except the extreme
tips of the tails of two of them, in 40 minutes.&nbsp; In none of
these cases, did the worms swallow, as far as could be seen, any
earth.&nbsp; They generally entered the ground close to the sides
of the pot.</p>
<p>A pot was next filled with very fine ferruginous sand, which
was pressed down, well watered, and thus rendered extremely
compact.&nbsp; A large worm left on the surface did not succeed
in penetrating it for some hours, and did not bury itself
completely until 25 hrs. 40 min. had elapsed.&nbsp; This was
effected by the sand being swallowed, as was evident by the large
quantity ejected from the vent, long before the whole body had
disappeared.&nbsp; Castings of a similar nature continued to be
ejected from the burrow during the whole of the following
day.</p>
<p>As doubts have been expressed by some writers whether worms
ever swallow earth solely for the sake of making their burrows,
some additional cases may be given.&nbsp; A mass of fine reddish
sand, 23 inches in thickness, left on the ground for nearly two
years, had been penetrated in many places by worms; and their
castings consisted partly of the reddish sand and partly of black
earth brought up from beneath the mass.&nbsp; This sand had been
dug up from a considerable depth, and was of so poor a nature
that weeds could not grow on it.&nbsp; It is therefore highly
improbable that it should have been swallowed by the worms as
food.&nbsp; Again in a field near my house the castings
frequently consist of almost pure chalk, which lies at only a
little depth beneath the surface; and here again it is very
improbable that the chalk should have been swallowed for the sake
of the very little organic matter which could have percolated
into it from the poor overlying pasture.&nbsp; Lastly, a casting
thrown up through the concrete and decayed mortar between the
tiles, with which the now ruined aisle of Beaulieu Abbey had
formerly been paved, was washed, so that the coarser matter alone
was left.&nbsp; This consisted of grains of quartz, micaceous
slate, other rocks, and bricks or tiles, many of them from 1/20
to 1/10 inch in diameter.&nbsp; No one will suppose that these
grains were swallowed as food, yet they formed more than half of
the casting, for they weighed 19 grains, the whole casting having
weighed 33 grains.&nbsp; Whenever a worm burrows to a depth of
some feet in undisturbed compact ground, it must form its passage
by swallowing the earth; for it is incredible that the ground
could yield on all sides to the pressure of the pharynx when
pushed forwards within the worm&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>That worms swallow a larger quantity of earth for the sake of
extracting any nutritious matter which it may contain than for
making their burrows, appears to me certain.&nbsp; But as this
old belief has been doubted by so high an authority as
Clapar&egrave;de, evidence in its favour must be given in some
detail.&nbsp; There is no <i>&agrave; priori</i> improbability in
such a belief, for besides other annelids, especially the
<i>Arenicola marina</i>, which throws up such a profusion of
castings on our tidal sands, and which it is believed thus
subsists, there are animals belonging to the most distinct
classes, which do not burrow, but habitually swallow large
quantities of sand; namely, the molluscan Onchidium and many
Echinoderms. <a name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97"
class="citation">[97]</a></p>
<p>If earth were swallowed only when worms deepened their burrows
or made new ones, castings would be thrown up only occasionally;
but in many places fresh castings may be seen every morning, and
the amount of earth ejected from the same burrow on successive
days is large.&nbsp; Yet worms do not burrow to a great depth,
except when the weather is very dry or intensely cold.&nbsp; On
my lawn the black vegetable mould or humus is only about 5 inches
in thickness, and overlies light-coloured or reddish clayey soil:
now when castings are thrown up in the greatest profusion, only a
small proportion are light coloured, and it is incredible that
the worms should daily make fresh burrows in every direction in
the thin superficial layer of dark-coloured mould, unless they
obtained nutriment of some kind from it.&nbsp; I have observed a
strictly analogous case in a field near my house where bright red
clay lay close beneath the surface.&nbsp; Again on one part of
the Downs near Winchester the vegetable mould overlying the chalk
was found to be only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness; and the
many castings here ejected were as black as ink and did not
effervesce with acids; so that the worms must have confined
themselves to this thin superficial layer of mould, of which
large quantities were daily swallowed.&nbsp; In another place at
no great distance the castings were white; and why the worms
should have burrowed into the chalk in some places and not in
others, I am unable to conjecture.</p>
<p>Two great piles of leaves had been left to decay in my
grounds, and months after their removal, the bare surface,
several yards in diameter, was so thickly covered during several
months with castings that they formed an almost continuous layer;
and the large number of worms which lived here must have
subsisted during these months on nutritious matter contained in
the black earth.</p>
<p>The lowest layer from another pile of decayed leaves mixed
with some earth was examined under a high power, and the number
of spores of various shapes and sizes which it contained was
astonishingly great; and these crushed in the gizzards of worms
may largely aid in supporting them.&nbsp; Whenever castings are
thrown up in the greatest number, few or no leaves are drawn into
the burrows; for instance the turf along a hedgerow, about 200
yards in length, was daily observed in the autumn during several
weeks, and every morning many fresh castings were seen; but not a
single leaf was drawn into these burrows.&nbsp; These castings
from their blackness and from the nature of the subsoil could not
have been brought up from a greater depth than 6 or 8
inches.&nbsp; On what could these worms have subsisted during
this whole time, if not on matter contained in the black
earth?&nbsp; On the other hand, whenever a large number of leaves
are drawn into the burrows, the worms seem to subsist chiefly on
them, for few earth-castings are then ejected on the
surface.&nbsp; This difference in the behaviour of worms at
different times, perhaps explains a statement by
Clapar&egrave;de, namely, that triturated leaves and earth are
always found in distinct parts of their intestines.</p>
<p>Worms sometimes abound in places where they can rarely or
never obtain dead or living leaves; for instance, beneath the
pavement in well-swept courtyards, into which leaves are only
occasionally blown.&nbsp; My son Horace examined a house, one
corner of which had subsided; and he found here in the cellar,
which was extremely damp, many small worm-castings thrown up
between the stones with which the cellar was paved; and in this
case it is improbable that the worms could ever have obtained
leaves.&nbsp; Mr. A. C. Horner confirms this account, as he has
seen castings in the cellars of his house, which is an old one at
Tonbridge.</p>
<p>But the best evidence, known to me, of worms subsisting for at
least considerable periods of time solely on the organic matter
contained in earth, is afforded by some facts communicated to me
by Dr. King.&nbsp; Near Nice large castings abound in
extraordinary numbers, so that 5 or 6 were often found within the
space of a square foot.&nbsp; They consist of fine, pale-coloured
earth, containing calcareous matter, which after having passed
through the bodies of worms and being dried, coheres with
considerable force.&nbsp; I have reason to believe that these
castings had been formed by species of Perich&aelig;ta, which
have been naturalized here from the East. <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a>&nbsp; They rise like towers, with
their summits often a little broader than their bases, sometimes
to a height of above 3 and often to a height of 2&frac12;
inches.&nbsp; The tallest of those which were measured was 3.3
inches in height and 1 inch in diameter.&nbsp; A small
cylindrical passage runs up the centre of each tower, through
which the worm ascends to eject the earth which it has swallowed,
and thus to add to its height.&nbsp; A structure of this kind
would not allow leaves being easily dragged from the surrounding
ground into the burrows; and Dr. King, who looked carefully,
never saw even a fragment of a leaf thus drawn in.&nbsp; Nor
could any trace be discovered of the worms having crawled down
the exterior surfaces of the towers in search of leaves; and had
they done so, tracks would almost certainly have been left on the
upper part whilst it remained soft.&nbsp; It does not, however,
follow that these worms do not draw leaves into their burrows
during some other season of the year, at which time they would
not build up their towers.</p>
<p>From the several foregoing cases, it can hardly be doubted
that worms swallow earth, not only for the sake of making their
burrows, but for obtaining food.&nbsp; Hensen, however, concludes
from his analyses of mould that worms probably could not live on
ordinary vegetable mould, though he admits that they might be
nourished to some extent by leaf-mould. <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a>&nbsp; But we have seen that worms
eagerly devour raw meat, fat, and dead worms; and ordinary mould
can hardly fail to contain many ova, larv&aelig;, and small
living or dead creatures, spores of cryptogamic plants, and
micrococci, such as those which give rise to saltpetre.&nbsp;
These various organisms, together with some cellulose from any
leaves and roots not utterly decayed, might well account for such
large quantities of mould being swallowed by worms.&nbsp; It may
be worth while here to recall the fact that certain species of
Utricularia, which grow in damp places in the tropics, possess
bladders beautifully constructed for catching minute subterranean
animals; and these traps would not have been developed unless
many small animals inhabited such soil.</p>
<p><i>The depth to which worms penetrate</i>, <i>and the
construction of their burrows</i>.&mdash;Although worms usually
live near the surface, yet they burrow to a considerable depth
during long-continued dry weather and severe cold.&nbsp; In
Scandinavia, according to Eisen, and in Scotland, according to
Mr. Lindsay Carnagie, the burrows run down to a depth of from 7
to 8 feet; in North Germany, according to Hoffmeister, from 6 to
8 feet, but Hensen says, from 3 to 6 feet.&nbsp; This latter
observer has seen worms frozen at a depth of 1&frac12; feet
beneath the surface.&nbsp; I have not myself had many
opportunities for observation, but I have often met with worms at
depths of 3 to 4 feet.&nbsp; In a bed of fine sand overlying the
chalk, which had never been disturbed, a worm was cut into two at
55 inches, and another was found here at Down in December at the
bottom of its burrow, at 61 inches beneath the surface.&nbsp;
Lastly, in earth near an old Roman Villa, which had not been
disturbed for many centuries, a worm was met with at a depth of
66 inches; and this was in the middle of August.</p>
<p>The burrows run down perpendicularly, or more commonly a
little obliquely.&nbsp; They are said sometimes to branch, but as
far as I have seen this does not occur, except in recently dug
ground and near the surface.&nbsp; They are generally, or as I
believe invariably, lined with a thin layer of fine,
dark-coloured earth voided by the worms; so that they must at
first be made a little wider than their ultimate diameter.&nbsp;
I have seen several burrows in undisturbed sand thus lined at a
depth of 4 ft. 6 in.; and others close to the surface thus lined
in recently dug ground.&nbsp; The walls of fresh burrows are
often dotted with little globular pellets of voided earth, still
soft and viscid; and these, as it appears, are spread out on all
sides by the worm as it travels up or down its burrow.&nbsp; The
lining thus formed becomes very compact and smooth when nearly
dry, and closely fits the worm&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; The minute
reflexed bristles which project in rows on all sides from the
body, thus have excellent points of support; and the burrow is
rendered well adapted for the rapid movement of the animal.&nbsp;
The lining appears also to strengthen the walls, and perhaps
saves the worm&rsquo;s body from being scratched.&nbsp; I think
so because several burrows which passed through a layer of sifted
coal-cinders, spread over turf to a thickness of 1&frac12; inch,
had been thus lined to an unusual thickness.&nbsp; In this case
the worms, judging from the castings, had pushed the cinders away
on all sides and had not swallowed any of them.&nbsp; In another
place, burrows similarly lined, passed through a layer of coarse
coal-cinders, 3&frac12; inches in thickness.&nbsp; We thus see
that the burrows are not mere excavations, but may rather be
compared with tunnels lined with cement.</p>
<p>The mouths of the burrow are in addition often lined with
leaves; and this is an instinct distinct from that of plugging
them up, and does not appear to have been hitherto noticed.&nbsp;
Many leaves of the Scotch-fir or pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>)
were given to worms kept in confinement in two pots; and when
after several weeks the earth was carefully broken up, the upper
parts of three oblique burrows were found surrounded for lengths
of 7, 4, and 3&frac12; inches with pine-leaves, together with
fragments of other leaves which had been given the worms as
food.&nbsp; Glass beads and bits of tile, which had been strewed
on the surface of the soil, were stuck into the interstices
between the pine-leaves; and these interstices were likewise
plastered with the viscid castings voided by the worms.&nbsp; The
structures thus formed cohered so well, that I succeeded in
removing one with only a little earth adhering to it.&nbsp; It
consisted of a slightly curved cylindrical case, the interior of
which could be seen through holes in the sides and at either
end.&nbsp; The pine-leaves had all been drawn in by their bases;
and the sharp points of the needles had been pressed into the
lining of voided earth.&nbsp; Had this not been effectually done,
the sharp points would have prevented the retreat of the worms
into their burrows; and these structures would have resembled
traps armed with converging points of wire, rendering the ingress
of an animal easy and its egress difficult or impossible.&nbsp;
The skill shown by these worms is noteworthy and is the more
remarkable, as the Scotch pine is not a native of this
district.</p>
<p>After having examined these burrows made by worms in
confinement, I looked at those in a flower-bed near some Scotch
pines.&nbsp; These had all been plugged up in the ordinary manner
with the leaves of this tree, drawn in for a length of from 1 to
1&frac12; inch; but the mouths of many of them were likewise
lined with them, mingled with fragments of other kinds of leaves,
drawn in to a depth of 4 or 5 inches.&nbsp; Worms often remain,
as formerly stated, for a long time close to the mouths of their
burrows, apparently for warmth; and the basket-like structures
formed of leaves would keep their bodies from coming into close
contact with the cold damp earth.&nbsp; That they habitually
rested on the pine-leaves, was rendered probable by their clean
and almost polished surfaces.</p>
<p>The burrows which run far down into the ground, generally, or
at least often, terminate in a little enlargement or
chamber.&nbsp; Here, according to Hoffmeister, one or several
worms pass the winter rolled up into a ball.&nbsp; Mr. Lindsay
Carnagie informed me (1838) that he had examined many burrows
over a stone-quarry in Scotland, where the overlying boulder-clay
and mould had recently been cleared away, and a little vertical
cliff thus left.&nbsp; In several cases the same burrow was a
little enlarged at two or three points one beneath the other; and
all the burrows terminated in a rather large chamber, at a depth
of 7 or 8 feet from the surface.&nbsp; These chambers contained
many small sharp bits of stone and husks of flax-seeds.&nbsp;
They must also have contained living seeds, for on the following
spring Mr. Carnagie saw grass-plants sprouting out of some of the
intersected chambers.&nbsp; I found at Abinger in Surrey two
burrows terminating in similar chambers at a depth of 36 and 41
inches, and these were lined or paved with little pebbles, about
as large as mustard seeds; and in one of the chambers there was a
decayed oat-grain, with its husk.&nbsp; Hensen likewise states
that the bottoms of the burrows are lined with little stones; and
where these could not be procured, seeds, apparently of the pear,
had been used, as many as fifteen having been carried down into a
single burrow, one of which had germinated. <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; We thus see how easily a
botanist might be deceived who wished to learn how long deeply
buried seeds remained alive, if he were to collect earth from a
considerable depth, on the supposition that it could contain only
seeds which had long lain buried.&nbsp; It is probable that the
little stones, as well as the seeds, are carried down from the
surface by being swallowed; for a surprising number of glass
beads, bits of tile and of glass were certainly thus carried down
by worms kept in pots; but some may have been carried down within
their mouths.&nbsp; The sole conjecture which I can form why
worms line their winter-quarters with little stones and seeds, is
to prevent their closely coiled-up bodies from coming into close
contact with the surrounding cold soil; and such contact would
perhaps interfere with their respiration which is effected by the
skin alone.</p>
<p>A worm after swallowing earth, whether for making its burrow
or for food, soon comes to the surface to empty its body.&nbsp;
The ejected earth is thoroughly mingled with the intestinal
secretions, and is thus rendered viscid.&nbsp; After being dried
it sets hard.&nbsp; I have watched worms during the act of
ejection, and when the earth was in a very liquid state it was
ejected in little spurts, and by a slow peristaltic movement when
not so liquid.&nbsp; It is not cast indifferently on any side,
but with some care, first on one and then on another side; the
tail being used almost like a trowel.&nbsp; When a worm comes to
the surface to eject earth, the tail protrudes, but when it
collects leaves its head must protrude.&nbsp; Worms therefore
must have the power of turning round in their closely-fitting
burrows; and this, as it appears to us, would be a difficult
feat.&nbsp; As soon as a little heap has been formed, the worm
apparently avoids, for the sake of safety, protruding its tail;
and the earthy matter is forced up through the previously
deposited soft mass.&nbsp; The mouth of the same burrow is used
for this purpose for a considerable time.&nbsp; In the case of
the tower-like castings (see Fig. 2) near Nice, and of the
similar but still taller towers from Bengal (hereafter to be
described and figured), a considerable degree of skill is
exhibited in their construction.&nbsp; Dr. King also observed
that the passage up these towers hardly ever ran in the same
exact line with the underlying burrow, so that a thin cylindrical
object such as a haulm of grass, could not be passed down the
tower into the burrow; and this change of direction probably
serves in some manner as a protection.</p>
<p>Worms do not always eject their castings on the surface of the
ground.&nbsp; When they can find any cavity, as when burrowing in
newly turned-up earth, or between the stems of banked-up plants,
they deposit their castings in such places.&nbsp; So again any
hollow beneath a large stone lying on the surface of the ground,
is soon filled up with their castings.&nbsp; According to Hensen,
old burrows are habitually used for this purpose; but as far as
my experience serves, this is not the case, excepting with those
near the surface in recently dug ground.&nbsp; I think that
Hensen may have been deceived by the walls of old burrows, lined
with black earth, having sunk in or collapsed; for black streaks
are thus left, and these are conspicuous when passing through
light-coloured soil, and might be mistaken for completely
filled-up burrows.</p>
<p>It is certain that old burrows collapse in the course of time;
for as we shall see in the next chapter, the fine earth voided by
worms, if spread out uniformly, would form in many places in the
course of a year a layer 0.2 of an inch in thickness; so that at
any rate this large amount is not deposited within the old unused
burrows.&nbsp; If the burrows did not collapse, the whole ground
would be first thickly riddled with holes to a depth of about ten
inches, and in fifty years a hollow unsupported space, ten inches
in depth, would be left.&nbsp; The holes left by the decay of
successively formed roots of trees and plants must likewise
collapse in the course of time.</p>
<p>The burrows of worms run down perpendicularly or a little
obliquely, and where the soil is at all argillaceous, there is no
difficulty in believing that the walls would slowly flow or slide
inwards during very wet weather.&nbsp; When, however, the soil is
sandy or mingled with many small stones, it can hardly be viscous
enough to flow inwards during even the wettest weather; but
another agency may here come into play.&nbsp; After much rain the
ground swells, and as it cannot expand laterally, the surface
rises; during dry weather it sinks again.&nbsp; For instance, a
large flat stone laid on the surface of a field sank 3.33 mm.
whilst the weather was dry between May 9th and June 13th, and
rose 1.91 mm, between September 7th and 19th of the same year,
much rain having fallen during the latter part of this
time.&nbsp; During frosts and thaws the movements were twice as
great.&nbsp; These observations were made by my son Horace, who
will hereafter publish an account of the movements of this stone
during successive wet and dry seasons, and of the effects of its
being undermined by worms.&nbsp; Now when the ground swells, if
it be penetrated by cylindrical holes, such as worm-burrows,
their walls will tend to yield and be pressed inwards; and the
yielding will be greater in the deeper parts (supposing the whole
to be equally moistened) from the greater weight of the
superincumbent soil which has to be raised, than in the parts
near the surface.&nbsp; When the ground dries, the walls will
shrink a little and the burrows will be a little enlarged.&nbsp;
Their enlargement, however, through the lateral contraction of
the ground, will not be favoured, but rather opposed, by the
weight of the superincumbent soil.</p>
<p><i>Distribution of Worms</i>.&mdash;Earth-worms are found in
all parts of the world, and some of the genera have an enormous
range. <a name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a>&nbsp; They inhabit the most isolated
islands; they abound in Iceland, and are known to exist in the
West Indies, St. Helena, Madagascar, New Caledonia and
Tahiti.&nbsp; In the Antarctic regions, worms from Kerguelen Land
have been described by Ray Lankester; and I found them in the
Falkland Islands.&nbsp; How they reach such isolated islands is
at present quite unknown.&nbsp; They are easily killed by
salt-water, and it does not appear probable that young worms or
their egg-capsules could be carried in earth adhering to the feet
or beaks of land-birds.&nbsp; Moreover Kerguelen Land is not now
inhabited by any land-bird.</p>
<p>In this volume we are chiefly concerned with the earth cast up
by worms, and I have gleaned a few facts on this subject with
respect to distant lands.&nbsp; Worms throw up plenty of castings
in the United States.&nbsp; In Venezuela, castings, probably
ejected by species of Uroch&aelig;ta, are common in the gardens
and fields, but not in the forests, as I hear from Dr. Ernst of
Caracas.&nbsp; He collected 156 castings from the court-yard of
his house, having an area of 200 square yards.&nbsp; They varied
in bulk from half a cubic centimeter to five cubic centimeters,
and were on an average three cubic centimeters.&nbsp; They were,
therefore, of small size in comparison with those often found in
England; for six large castings from a field near my house
averaged 16 cubic centimeters.&nbsp; Several species of
earth-worms are common in St. Catharina in South Brazil, and
Fritz M&uuml;ller informs me &ldquo;that in most parts of the
forests and pasture-lands, the whole soil, to a depth of a
quarter of a metre, looks as if it had passed repeatedly through
the intestines of earth-worms, even where hardly any castings are
to be seen on the surface.&rdquo;&nbsp; A gigantic but very rare
species is found there, the burrows of which are sometimes even
two centimeters or nearly 0.8 of an inch in diameter, and which
apparently penetrate the ground to a great depth.</p>
<p>In the dry climate of New South Wales, I hardly expected that
worms would be common; but Dr. G. Krefft of Sydney, to whom I
applied, after making inquiries from gardeners and others, and
from his own observations, informs me that their castings
abound.&nbsp; He sent me some collected after heavy rain, and
they consisted of little pellets, about 0.15 inch in diameter;
and the blackened sandy earth of which they were formed still
cohered with considerable tenacity.</p>
<p>The late Mr. John Scott of the Botanic Gardens near Calcutta
made many observations for me on worms living under the hot and
humid climate of Bengal.&nbsp; The castings abound almost
everywhere, in jungles and in the open ground, to a greater
degree, as he thinks, than in England.&nbsp; After the water has
subsided from the flooded rice-fields, the whole surface very
soon becomes studded with castings&mdash;a fact which much
surprised Mr. Scott, as he did not know how long worms could
survive beneath water.&nbsp; They cause much trouble in the
Botanic garden, &ldquo;for some of the finest of our lawns can be
kept in anything like order only by being almost daily rolled; if
left undisturbed for a few days they become studded with large
castings.&rdquo;&nbsp; These closely resemble those described as
abounding near Nice; and they are probably the work of a species
of Perich&aelig;ta.&nbsp; They stand up like towers, with an open
passage in the centre.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A figure of one of these castings from a photograph is here
given (Fig. 3).&nbsp; The largest received by me was 3&frac12;
inches in height and 1.35 inch in diameter; another was only
&frac34; inch in diameter and 2&frac34; in height.&nbsp; In the
following year, Mr. Scott measured several of the largest; one
was 6 inches in height and nearly 1&frac12; in diameter: two
others were 5 inches in height and respectively 2 and rather more
than 2&frac12; inches in diameter.&nbsp; The average weight of
the 22 castings sent to me was 35 grammes (1&frac14; oz.); and
one of them weighed 44.8 grammes (or 2 oz.). All these castings
were thrown up either in one night or in two.&nbsp; Where the
ground in Bengal is dry, as under large trees, castings of a
different kind are found in vast numbers: these consist of little
oval or conical bodies, from about the 1/20 to rather above 1/10
of an inch in length.&nbsp; They are obviously voided by a
distinct species of worms.</p>
<p>The period during which worms near Calcutta display such
extraordinary activity lasts for only a little over two months,
namely, during the cool season after the rains.&nbsp; At this
time they are generally found within about 10 inches beneath the
surface.&nbsp; During the hot season they burrow to a greater
depth, and are then found coiled up and apparently
hybernating.&nbsp; Mr. Scott has never seen them at a greater
depth than 2&frac12; feet, but has heard of their having been
found at 4 feet.&nbsp; Within the forests, fresh castings may be
found even during the hot season.&nbsp; The worms in the Botanic
garden, during the cool and dry season, draw many leaves and
little sticks into the mouths of their burrows, like our English
worms; but they rarely act in this manner during the rainy
season.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott saw worm-castings on the lofty mountains of Sikkim
in North India.&nbsp; In South India Dr. King found in one place,
on the plateau of the Nilgiris, at an elevation of 7000 feet,
&ldquo;a good many castings,&rdquo; which are interesting for
their great size.&nbsp; The worms which eject them are seen only
during the wet season, and are reported to be from 12 to 15
inches in length, and as thick as a man&rsquo;s little
finger.&nbsp; These castings were collected by Dr. King after a
period of 110 days without any rain; and they must have been
ejected either during the north-east or more probably during the
previous south-west monsoon; for their surfaces had suffered some
disintegration and they were penetrated by many fine roots.&nbsp;
A drawing is here given (Fig. 4) of one which seems to have best
retained its original size and appearance.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
some loss from disintegration, five of the largest of these
castings (after having been well sun-dried) weighed each on an
average 89.5 grammes, or above 3 oz.; and the largest weighed
123.14 grammes, or 4&#8531; oz.,&mdash;that is, above a quarter
of a pound!&nbsp; The largest convolutions were rather more than
one inch in diameter; but it is probable that they had subsided a
little whilst soft, and that their diameters had thus been
increased.&nbsp; Some had flowed so much that they now consisted
of a pile of almost flat confluent cakes.&nbsp; All were formed
of fine, rather light-coloured earth, and were surprisingly hard
and compact, owing no doubt to the animal matter by which the
particles of earth had been cemented together.&nbsp; They did not
disintegrate, even when left for some hours in water.&nbsp;
Although they had been cast up on the surface of gravelly soil,
they contained extremely few bits of rock, the largest of which
was only 0.15 inch in diameter.</p>
<p>Dr. King saw in Ceylon a worm about 2 feet in length and
&frac12; inch in diameter; and he was told that it was a very
common species during the wet season.&nbsp; These worms must
throw up castings at least as large as those on the Nilgiri
Mountains; but Dr. King saw none during his short visit to
Ceylon.</p>
<p>Sufficient facts have now been given, showing that worms do
much work in bringing up fine earth to the surface in most or all
parts of the world, and under the most different climates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now come to the more immediate
subject of this volume, namely, the amount of earth which is
brought up by worms from beneath the surface, and is afterwards
spread out more or less completely by the rain and wind.&nbsp;
The amount can be judged of by two methods,&mdash;by the rate at
which objects left on the surface are buried, and more accurately
by weighing the quantity brought up within a given time.&nbsp; We
will begin with the first method, as it was first followed.</p>
<p>Near Mael Hall in Staffordshire, quick-lime had been spread
about the year 1827 thickly over a field of good pasture-land,
which had not since been ploughed.&nbsp; Some square holes were
dug in this field in the beginning of October 1837; and the
sections showed a layer of turf, formed by the matted roots of
the grasses, &frac12; inch in thickness, beneath which, at a
depth of 2&frac12; inches (or 3 inches from the surface), a layer
of the lime in powder or in small lumps could be distinctly seen
running all round the vertical sides of the holes.&nbsp; The soil
beneath the layer of lime was either gravelly or of a coarse
sandy nature, and differed considerably in appearance from the
overlying dark-coloured fine mould.&nbsp; Coal-cinders had been
spread over a part of this same field either in the year 1833 or
1834; and when the above holes were dug, that is after an
interval of 3 or 4 years, the cinders formed a line of black
spots round the holes, at a depth of 1 inch beneath the surface,
parallel to and above the white layer of lime.&nbsp; Over another
part of this field cinders had been strewed, only about
half-a-year before, and these either still lay on the surface or
were entangled among the roots of the grasses; and I here saw the
commencement of the burying process, for worm-castings had been
heaped on several of the smaller fragments.&nbsp; After an
interval of 4&frac34; years this field was re-examined, and now
the two layers of lime and cinders were found almost everywhere
at a greater depth than before by nearly 1 inch, we will say by
&frac34; of an inch.&nbsp; Therefore mould to an average
thickness of 0.22 of an inch had been annually brought up by the
worms, and had been spread over the surface of this field.</p>
<p>Coal-cinders had been strewed over another field, at a date
which could not be positively ascertained, so thickly that they
formed (October, 1837) a layer, 1 inch in thickness at a depth of
about 3 inches from the surface.&nbsp; The layer was so
continuous that the over-lying dark vegetable mould was connected
with the sub-soil of red clay only by the roots of the grasses;
and when these were broken, the mould and the red clay fell
apart.&nbsp; In a third field, on which coal-cinders and burnt
marl had been strewed several times at unknown dates, holes were
dug in 1842; and a layer of cinders could be traced at a depth of
3&frac12; inches, beneath which at a depth of 9&frac12; inches
from the surface there was a line of cinders together with burnt
marl.&nbsp; On the sides of one hole there were two layers of
cinders, at 2 and 3&frac12; inches beneath the surface; and below
them at a depth in parts of 9&frac12;, and in other parts of
10&frac12; inches there were fragments of burnt marl.&nbsp; In a
fourth field two layers of lime, one above the other, could be
distinctly traced, and beneath them a layer of cinders and burnt
marl at a depth of from 10 to 12 inches below the surface.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A piece of waste, swampy land was enclosed, drained, ploughed,
harrowed and thickly covered in the year 1822 with burnt marl and
cinders.&nbsp; It was sowed with grass seeds, and now supports a
tolerably good but coarse pasture.&nbsp; Holes were dug in this
field in 1837, or 15 years after its reclamation, and we see in
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 5), reduced to half of the natural
scale, that the turf was &frac12; inch thick, beneath which there
was a layer of vegetable mould 2&frac12; inches thick.&nbsp; This
layer did not contain fragments of any kind; but beneath it there
was a layer of mould, 1&frac12; inch in thickness, full of
fragments of burnt marl, conspicuous from their red colour, one
of which near the bottom was an inch in length; and other
fragments of coal-cinders together with a few white quartz
pebbles.&nbsp; Beneath this layer and at a depth of 4&frac12;
inches from the surface, the original black, peaty, sandy soil
with a few quartz pebbles was encountered.&nbsp; Here therefore
the fragments of burnt marl and cinders had been covered in the
course of 15 years by a layer of fine vegetable mould, only
2&frac12; inches in thickness, excluding the turf.&nbsp; Six and
a half years subsequently this field was re-examined, and the
fragments were now found at from 4 to 5 inches beneath the
surface.&nbsp; So that in this interval of 6&frac12; years, about
1&frac12; inch of mould had been added to the superficial
layer.&nbsp; I am surprised that a greater quantity had not been
brought up during the whole 21&frac12; years, for in the closely
underlying black, peaty soil there were many worms.&nbsp; It is,
however, probable that formerly, whilst the land remained poor,
worms were scanty; and the mould would then have accumulated
slowly.&nbsp; The average annual increase of thickness for the
whole period is 0.19 of an inch.</p>
<p>Two other cases are worth recording.&nbsp; In the spring of
1835, a field, which had long existed as poor pasture and was so
swampy that it trembled slightly when stamped on, was thickly
covered with red sand so that the whole surface appeared at first
bright red.&nbsp; When holes were dug in this field after an
interval of about 2&frac12; years, the sand formed a layer at a
depth of &frac34; in. beneath the surface.&nbsp; In 1842 (i.e., 7
years after the sand had been laid on) fresh holes were dug, and
now the red sand formed a distinct layer, 2 inches beneath the
surface, or 1&frac12; inch beneath the turf; so that on an
average, 0.21 inch of mould had been annually brought to the
surface.&nbsp; Immediately beneath the layer of red sand, the
original substratum of black sandy peat extended.</p>
<p>A grass field, likewise not far from Maer Hall, had formerly
been thickly covered with marl, and was then left for several
years as pasture; it was afterwards ploughed.&nbsp; A friend had
three trenches dug in this field 28 years after the application
of the marl, <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126"
class="citation">[126]</a> and a layer of the marl fragments
could be traced at a depth, carefully measured, of 12 inches in
some parts, and of 14 inches in other parts.&nbsp; This
difference in depth depended on the layer being horizontal,
whilst the surface consisted of ridges and furrows from the field
having been ploughed.&nbsp; The tenant assured me that it had
never been turned up to a greater depth than from 6 to 8 inches;
and as the fragments formed an unbroken horizontal layer from 12
to 14 inches beneath the surface, these must have been buried by
the worms whilst the land was in pasture before it was ploughed,
for otherwise they would have been indiscriminately scattered by
the plough throughout the whole thickness of the soil.&nbsp;
Four-and-a-half years afterwards I had three holes dug in this
field, in which potatoes had been lately planted, and the layer
of marl-fragments was now found 13 inches beneath the bottoms of
the furrows, and therefore probably 15 inches beneath the general
level of the field.&nbsp; It should, however, be observed that
the thickness of the blackish sandy soil, which had been thrown
up by the worms above the marl-fragments in the course of
32&frac12; years, would have measured less than 15 inches, if the
field had always remained as pasture, for the soil would in this
case have been much more compact.&nbsp; The fragments of marl
almost rested on an undisturbed substratum of white sand with
quartz pebbles; and as this would be little attractive to worms,
the mould would hereafter be very slowly increased by their
action.</p>
<p>We will now give some cases of the action of worms, on land
differing widely from the dry sandy or the swampy pastures just
described.&nbsp; The chalk formation extends all round my house
in Kent; and its surface, from having been exposed during an
immense period to the dissolving action of rain-water, is
extremely irregular, being abruptly festooned and penetrated by
many deep well-like cavities. <a name="citation128"></a><a
href="#footnote128" class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; During the
dissolution of the chalk, the insoluble matter, including a vast
number of unrolled flints of all sizes, has been left on the
surface and forms a bed of stiff red clay, full of flints, and
generally from 6 to 14 feet in thickness.&nbsp; Over the red
clay, wherever the land has long remained as pasture, there is a
layer a few inches in thickness, of dark-coloured vegetable
mould.</p>
<p>A quantity of broken chalk was spread, on December 20, 1842,
over a part of a field near my house, which had existed as
pasture certainly for 30, probably for twice or thrice as many
years.&nbsp; The chalk was laid on the land for the sake of
observing at some future period to what depth it would become
buried.&nbsp; At the end of November, 1871, that is after an
interval of 29 years, a trench was dug across this part of the
field; and a line of white nodules could be traced on both sides
of the trench, at a depth of 7 inches from the surface.&nbsp; The
mould, therefore, (excluding the turf) had here been thrown up at
an average rate of 0.22 inch per year.&nbsp; Beneath the line of
chalk nodules there was in parts hardly any fine earth free of
flints, while in other parts there was a layer, 2&frac14; inches
in thickness.&nbsp; In this latter case the mould was altogether
9&frac14; inches thick; and in one such spot a nodule of chalk
and a smooth flint pebble, both of which must have been left at
some former time on the surface, were found at this depth.&nbsp;
At from 11 to 12 inches beneath the surface, the undisturbed
reddish clay, full of flints, extended.&nbsp; The appearance of
the above nodules of chalk surprised me, much at first, as they
closely resembled water-worn pebbles, whereas the freshly-broken
fragments had been angular.&nbsp; But on examining the nodules
with a lens, they no longer appeared water-worn, for their
surfaces were pitted through unequal corrosion, and minute, sharp
points, formed of broken fossil shells, projected from
them.&nbsp; It was evident that the corners of the original
fragments of chalk had been wholly dissolved, from presenting a
large surface to the carbonic acid dissolved in the rain-water
and to that generated in soil containing vegetable matter, as
well as to the humus-acids. <a name="citation131"></a><a
href="#footnote131" class="citation">[131]</a>&nbsp; The
projecting corners would also, relatively to the other parts,
have been embraced by a larger number of living rootlets; and
these have the power of even attacking marble, as Sachs has
shown.&nbsp; Thus, in the course of 29 years, buried angular
fragments of chalk had been converted into well-rounded
nodules.</p>
<p>Another part of this same field was mossy, and as it was
thought that sifted coal-cinders would improve the pasture, a
thick layer was spread over this part either in 1842 or 1843, and
another layer some years afterwards.&nbsp; In 1871 a trench was
here dug, and many cinders lay in a line at a depth of 7 inches
beneath the surface, with another line at a depth of 5&frac12;
inches parallel to the one beneath.&nbsp; In another part of this
field, which had formerly existed as a separate one, and which it
was believed had been pasture-land for more than a century,
trenches were dug to see how thick the vegetable mould was.&nbsp;
By chance the first trench was made at a spot where at some
former period, certainly more than forty years before, a large
hole had been filled up with coarse red clay, flints, fragments
of chalk, and gravel; and here the fine vegetable mould was only
from 4&#8539; to 4&#8540; inches in thickness.&nbsp; In another
and undisturbed place, the mould varied much in thickness,
namely, from 6&frac12; to 8&frac12; inches; beneath which a few
small fragments of brick were found in one place.&nbsp; From
these several cases, it would appear that during the last 29
years mould has been heaped on the surface at an average annual
rate of from 0.2 to 0.22 of an inch.&nbsp; But in this district
when a ploughed field is first laid down in grass, the mould
accumulates at a much slower rate.&nbsp; The rate, also, must
become very much slower after a bed of mould, several inches in
thickness, has been formed; for the worms then live chiefly near
the surface, and burrow down to a greater depth so as to bring up
fresh earth from below, only during the winter when the weather
is very cold (at which time worms were found in this field at a
depth of 26 inches) and during summer, when the weather is very
dry.</p>
<p>A field, which adjoins the one just described, slopes in one
part rather steeply (viz., at from 10&deg; to 15&deg;); this part
was last ploughed in 1841, was then harrowed and left to become
pasture-land.&nbsp; For several years it was clothed with an
extremely scant vegetation, and was so thickly covered with small
and large flints (some of them half as large as a child&rsquo;s
head) that the field was always called by my sons &ldquo;the
stony field.&rdquo;&nbsp; When they ran down the slope the stones
clattered together, I remember doubting whether I should live to
see these larger flints covered with vegetable mould and
turf.&nbsp; But the smaller stones disappeared before many years
had elapsed, as did every one of the larger ones after a time; so
that after thirty years (1871) a horse could gallop over the
compact turf from one end of the field to the other, and not
strike a single stone with his shoes.&nbsp; To anyone who
remembered the appearance of the field in 1842, the
transformation was wonderful.&nbsp; This was certainly the work
of the worms, for though castings were not frequent for several
years, yet some were thrown up month after month, and these
gradually increased in numbers as the pasture improved.&nbsp; In
the year 1871 a trench was dug on the above slope, and the blades
of grass were cut off close to the roots, so that the thickness
of the turf and of the vegetable mould could be measured
accurately.&nbsp; The turf was rather less than half an inch, and
the mould, which did not contain any stones, 2&frac12; inches in
thickness.&nbsp; Beneath this lay coarse clayey earth full of
flints, like that in any of the neighbouring ploughed
fields.&nbsp; This coarse earth easily fell apart from the
overlying mould when a spit was lifted up.&nbsp; The average rate
of accumulation of the mould during the whole thirty years was
only .083 inch per year (i.e., nearly one inch in twelve years);
but the rate must have been much slower at first, and afterwards
considerably quicker.</p>
<p>The transformation in the appearance of this field, which had
been effected beneath my eyes, was afterwards rendered the more
striking, when I examined in Knole Park a dense forest of lofty
beech-trees, beneath which nothing grew.&nbsp; Here the ground
was thickly strewed with large naked stones, and worm-castings
were almost wholly absent.&nbsp; Obscure lines and irregularities
on the surface indicated that the land had been cultivated some
centuries ago.&nbsp; It is probable that a thick wood of young
beech-trees sprung up so quickly, that time enough was not
allowed for worms to cover up the stones with their castings,
before the site became unfitted for their existence.&nbsp; Anyhow
the contrast between the state of the now miscalled &ldquo;stony
field,&rdquo; well stocked with worms, and the present state of
the ground beneath the old beech-trees in Knole Park, where worms
appeared to be absent, was striking.</p>
<p>A narrow path running across part of my lawn was paved in 1843
with small flagstones, set edgeways; but worms threw up many
castings and weeds grew thickly between them.&nbsp; During
several years the path was weeded and swept; but ultimately the
weeds and worms prevailed, and the gardener ceased to sweep,
merely mowing off the weeds, as often as the lawn was
mowed.&nbsp; The path soon became almost covered up, and after
several years no trace of it was left.&nbsp; On removing, in
1877, the thin overlying layer of turf, the small flag-stones,
all in their proper places, were found covered by an inch of fine
mould.</p>
<p>Two recently published accounts of substances strewed on the
surface of pasture-land, having become buried through the action
of worms, may be here noticed.&nbsp; The Rev. H. C. Key had a
ditch cut in a field, over which coal-ashes had been spread, as
it was believed, eighteen years before; and on the clean-cut
perpendicular sides of the ditch, at a depth of at least seven
inches, there could be seen, for a length of 60 yards, &ldquo;a
distinct, very even, narrow line of coal-ashes, mixed with small
coal, perfectly parallel with the top-sward.&rdquo; <a
name="citation136a"></a><a href="#footnote136a"
class="citation">[136a]</a>&nbsp; This parallelism and the length
of the section give interest to the case.&nbsp; Secondly, Mr.
Dancer states <a name="citation136b"></a><a href="#footnote136b"
class="citation">[136b]</a> that crushed bones had been thickly
strewed over a field; and &ldquo;some years afterwards&rdquo;
these were found &ldquo;several inches below the surface, at a
uniform depth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Zincke informs me that he has lately had an
orchard dug to the unusual depth of 4 feet.&nbsp; The upper 18
inches consisted of dark-coloured vegetable mould, and the next
18 inches of sandy loam, containing in the lower part many rolled
pieces of sandstone, with some bits of brick and tile, probably
of Roman origin, as remains of this period have been found close
by.&nbsp; The sandy loam rested on an indurated ferruginous pan
of yellow clay, on the surface of which two perfect celts were
found.&nbsp; If, as seems probable, the celts were originally
left on the surface of the land, they have since been covered up
with earth 3 feet in thickness, all of which has probably passed
through the bodies of worms, excepting the stones which may have
been scattered on the surface at different times, together with
manure or by other means.&nbsp; It is difficult otherwise to
understand the source of the 18 inches of sandy loam, which
differed from the overlying dark vegetable mould, after both had
been burnt, only in being of a brighter red colour, and in not
being quite so fine-grained.&nbsp; But on this view we must
suppose that the carbon in vegetable mould, when it lies at some
little depth beneath the surface and does not continually receive
decaying vegetable matter from above, loses its dark colour in
the course of centuries; but whether this is probable I do not
know.</p>
<p>Worms appear to act in the same manner in New Zealand as in
Europe; for Professor J. von Haast has described <a
name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a> a section near the coast, consisting
of mica-schist, &ldquo;covered by 5 or 6 feet of loess, above
which about 12 inches of vegetable soil had
accumulated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Between the loess and the mould there
was a layer from 3 to 6 inches in thickness, consisting of
&ldquo;cores, implements, flakes, and chips, all manufactured
from hard basaltic rock.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is therefore probable
that the aborigines, at some former period, had left these
objects on the surface, and that they had afterwards been slowly
covered up by the castings of worms.</p>
<p>Farmers in England are well aware that objects of all kinds,
left on the surface of pasture-land, after a time disappear, or,
as they say, work themselves downwards.&nbsp; How powdered lime,
cinders, and heavy stones, can work down, and at the same rate,
through the matted roots of a grass-covered surface, is a
question which has probably never occurred to them. <a
name="citation138b"></a><a href="#footnote138b"
class="citation">[138b]</a></p>
<p><i>The Sinking of great Stones through the Action of
Worms</i>.&mdash;When a stone of large size and of irregular
shape is left on the surface of the ground, it rests, of course,
on the more protuberant parts; but worms soon fill up with their
castings all the hollow spaces on the lower side; for, as Hensen
remarks, they like the shelter of stones.&nbsp; As soon as the
hollows are filled up, the worms eject the earth which they have
swallowed beyond the circumference of the stones; and thus the
surface of the ground is raised all round the stone.&nbsp; As the
burrows excavated directly beneath the stone after a time
collapse, the stone sinks a little. <a name="citation139"></a><a
href="#footnote139" class="citation">[139]</a>&nbsp; Hence it is,
that boulders which at some ancient period have rolled down from
a rocky mountain or cliff on to a meadow at its base, are always
somewhat imbedded in the soil; and, when removed, leave an exact
impression of their lower surfaces in the underlying fine
mould.&nbsp; If, however, a boulder is of such huge dimensions,
that the earth beneath is kept dry, such earth will not be
inhabited by worms, and the boulder will not sink into the
ground.</p>
<p>A lime-kiln formerly stood in a grass-field near Leith Hill
Place in Surrey, and was pulled down 35 years before my visit;
all the loose rubbish had been carted away, excepting three large
stones of quartzose sandstone, which it was thought might
hereafter be of some use.&nbsp; An old workman remembered that
they had been left on a bare surface of broken bricks and mortar,
close to the foundations of the kiln; but the whole surrounding
surface is now covered with turf and mould.&nbsp; The two largest
of these stones had never since been moved; nor could this easily
have been done, as, when I had them removed, it was the work of
two men with levers.&nbsp; One of these stones, and not the
largest, was 64 inches long, 17 inches broad, and from 9 to 10
inches in thickness.&nbsp; Its lower surface was somewhat
protuberant in the middle; and this part still rested on broken
bricks and mortar, showing the truth of the old workman&rsquo;s
account.&nbsp; Beneath the brick rubbish the natural sandy soil,
full of fragments of sandstone was found; and this could have
yielded very little, if at all, to the weight of the stone, as
might have been expected if the sub-soil had been clay.&nbsp; The
surface of the field, for a distance of about 9 inches round the
stone, gradually sloped up to it, and close to the stone stood in
most places about 4 inches above the surrounding ground.&nbsp;
The base of the stone was buried from 1 to 2 inches beneath the
general level, and the upper surface projected about 8 inches
above this level, or about 4 inches above the sloping border of
turf.&nbsp; After the removal of the stone it became evident that
one of its pointed ends must at first have stood clear above the
ground by some inches, but its upper surface was now on a level
with the surrounding turf.&nbsp; When the stone was removed, an
exact cast of its lower side, forming a shallow crateriform
hollow, was left, the inner surface of which consisted of fine
black mould, excepting where the more protuberant parts rested on
the brick-rubbish.&nbsp; A transverse section of this stone,
together with its bed, drawn from measurements made after it had
been displaced, is here given on a scale of &frac12; inch to a
foot (Fig. 6).&nbsp; The turf-covered border which sloped up to
the stone, consisted of fine vegetable mould, in one part 7
inches in thickness.&nbsp; This evidently consisted of
worm-castings, several of which had been recently ejected.&nbsp;
The whole stone had sunk in the thirty-five years, as far as I
could judge, about 1&frac12; inch; and this must have been due to
the brick-rubbish beneath the more protuberant parts having been
undermined by worms.&nbsp; At this rate the upper surface of the
stone, if it had been left undisturbed, would have sunk to the
general level of the field in 247 years; but before this could
have occurred, some earth would have been washed down by heavy
rain from the castings on the raised border of turf over the
upper surface of the stone.</p>
<p>The second stone was larger that the one just described, viz.,
67 inches in length, 39 in breadth, and 15 in thickness.&nbsp;
The lower surface was nearly flat, so that the worms must soon
have been compelled to eject their castings beyond its
circumference.&nbsp; The stone as a whole had sunk about 2 inches
into the ground.&nbsp; At this rate it would have required 262
years for its upper surface to have sunk to the general level of
the field.&nbsp; The upwardly sloping, turf-covered border round
the stone was broader than in the last case, viz., from 14 to 16
inches; and why this should be so, I could see no reason.&nbsp;
In most parts this border was not so high as in the last case,
viz., from 2 to 2&frac12; inches, but in one place it was as much
as 5&frac12;.&nbsp; Its average height close to the stone was
probably about 3 inches, and it thinned out to nothing.&nbsp; If
so, a layer of fine earth, 15 inches in breadth and 1&frac12;
inch in average thickness, of sufficient length to surround the
whole of the much elongated slab, must have been brought up by
the worms in chief part from beneath the stone in the course of
35 years.&nbsp; This amount would be amply sufficient to account
for its having sunk about 2 inches into the ground; more
especially if we bear in mind that a good deal of the finest
earth would have been washed by heavy rain from the castings
ejected on the sloping border down to the level of the
field.&nbsp; Some fresh castings were seen close to the
stone.&nbsp; Nevertheless, on digging a large hole to a depth of
18 inches where the stone had lain, only two worms and a few
burrows were seen, although the soil was damp and seemed
favourable for worms.&nbsp; There were some large colonies of
ants beneath the stone, and possibly since their establishment
the worms had decreased in number.</p>
<p>The third stone was only about half as large as the others;
and two strong boys could together have rolled it over.&nbsp; I
have no doubt that it had been rolled over at a moderately recent
time, for it now lay at some distance from the two other stones
at the bottom of a little adjoining slope.&nbsp; It rested also
on fine earth, instead of partly on brick-rubbish.&nbsp; In
agreement with this conclusion, the raised surrounding border of
turf was only 1 inch high in some parts, and 2 inches in other
parts.&nbsp; There were no colonies of ants beneath this stone,
and on digging a hole where it had lain, several burrows and
worms were found.</p>
<p>At Stonehenge, some of the outer Druidical stones are now
prostrate, having fallen at a remote but unknown period; and
these have become buried to a moderate depth in the ground.&nbsp;
They are surrounded by sloping borders of turf, on which recent
castings were seen.&nbsp; Close to one of these fallen stones,
which was 17 ft long, 6 ft. broad, and 28&frac12; inches thick, a
hole was dug; and here the vegetable mould was at least 9&frac12;
inches in thickness.&nbsp; At this depth a flint was found, and a
little higher up on one side of the hole a fragment of
glass.&nbsp; The base of the stone lay about 9&frac12; inches
beneath the level of the surrounding ground, and its upper
surface 19 inches above the ground.</p>
<p>A hole was also dug close to a second huge stone, which in
falling had broken into two pieces; and this must have happened
long ago, judging from the weathered aspect of the fractured
ends.&nbsp; The base was buried to a depth of 10 inches, as was
ascertained by driving an iron skewer horizontally into the
ground beneath it.&nbsp; The vegetable mould forming the
turf-covered sloping border round the stone, on which many
castings had recently been ejected, was 10 inches in thickness;
and most of this mould must have been brought up by worms from
beneath its base.&nbsp; At a distance of 8 yards from the stone,
the mould was only 5&frac12; inches in thickness (with a piece of
tobacco pipe at a depth of 4 inches), and this rested on broken
flint and chalk which could not have easily yielded to the
pressure or weight of the stone.</p>
<p>A straight rod was fixed horizontally (by the aid of a
spirit-level) across a third fallen stone, which was 7 feet 9
inches long; and the contour of the projecting parts and of the
adjoining ground, which was not quite level, was thus
ascertained, as shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 7) on a
scale of &frac12; inch to a foot.&nbsp; The turf-covered border
sloped up to the stone on one side to a height of 4 inches, and
on the opposite side to only 2&frac12; inches above the general
level.&nbsp; A hole was dug on the eastern side, and the base of
the stone was here found to lie at a depth of 4 inches beneath
the general level of the ground, and of 8 inches beneath the top
of the sloping turf-covered border.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sufficient evidence has now been given showing that small
objects left on the surface of the land where worms abound soon
get buried, and that large stones sink slowly downwards through
the same means.&nbsp; Every step of the process could be
followed, from the accidental deposition of a single casting on a
small object lying loose on the surface, to its being entangled
amidst the matted roots of the turf, and lastly to its being
embedded in the mould at various depths beneath the
surface.&nbsp; When the same field was re-examined after the
interval of a few years, such objects were found at a greater
depth than before.&nbsp; The straightness and regularity of the
lines formed by the imbedded objects, and their parallelism with
the surface of the land, are the most striking features of the
case; for this parallelism shows how equably the worms must have
worked; the result being, however, partly the effect of the
washing down of the fresh castings by rain.&nbsp; The specific
gravity of the objects does not affect their rate of sinking, as
could be seen by porous cinders, burnt marl, chalk and quartz
pebbles, having all sunk to the same depth within the same
time.&nbsp; Considering the nature of the substratum, which at
Leith Hill Place was sandy soil including many bits of rock, and
at Stonehenge, chalk-rubble with broken flints; considering,
also, the presence of the turf-covered sloping border of mould
round the great fragments of stone at both these places, their
sinking does not appear to have been sensibly aided by their
weight, though this was considerable. <a

<p><i>On the number of worms which live within a given
space</i>.&mdash;We will now show, firstly, what a vast number of
worms live unseen by us beneath our feet, and, secondly, the
actual weight of the earth which they bring up to the surface
within a given space and within a given time.&nbsp; Hensen, who
has published so full and interesting an account of the habits of
worms, <a name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a> calculates, from the number which he
found in a measured space, that there must exist 133,000 living
worms in a hectare of land, or 53,767 in an acre.&nbsp; This
latter number of worms would weigh 356 pounds, taking
Hensen&rsquo;s standard of the weight of a single worm, namely,
three grams.&nbsp; It should, however, be noted that this
calculation is founded on the numbers found in a garden, and
Hensen believes that worms are here twice as numerous as in
corn-fields.&nbsp; The above result, astonishing though it be,
seems to me credible, judging from the number of worms which I
have sometimes seen, and from the number daily destroyed by birds
without the species being exterminated.&nbsp; Some barrels of bad
ale were left on Mr. Miller&rsquo;s land, <a
name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149"
class="citation">[149]</a> in the hope of making vinegar, but the
vinegar proved bad, and the barrels were upset.&nbsp; It should
be premised that acetic acid is so deadly a poison to worms that
Perrier found that a glass rod dipped into this acid and then
into a considerable body of water in which worms were immersed,
invariably killed them quickly.&nbsp; On the morning after the
barrels had been upset, &ldquo;the heaps of worms which lay dead
on the ground were so amazing, that if Mr. Miller had not seen
them, he could not have thought it possible for such numbers to
have existed in the space.&rdquo;&nbsp; As further evidence of
the large number of worms which live in the ground, Hensen states
that he found in a garden sixty-four open burrows in a space of
14&frac12; square feet, that is, nine in 2 square feet.&nbsp; But
the burrows are sometimes much more numerous, for when digging in
a grass-field near Maer Hall, I found a cake of dry earth, as
large as my two open hands, which was penetrated by seven
burrows, as large as goose-quills.</p>
<p><i>Weight of the earth ejected from a single burrow</i>,
<i>and from all the burrows within a given space</i>.&mdash;With
respect to the weight of the earth daily ejected by worms, Hensen
found that it amounted, in the case of some worms which he kept
in confinement, and which he appears to have fed with leaves, to
only 0.5 gram, or less than 8 grains per diem.&nbsp; But a very
much larger amount must be ejected by worms in their natural
state, at the periods when they consume earth as food instead of
leaves, and when they are making deep burrows.&nbsp; This is
rendered almost certain by the following weights of the castings
thrown up at the mouths of single burrows; the whole of which
appeared to have been ejected within no long time, as was
certainly the case in several instances.&nbsp; The castings were
dried (excepting in one specified instance) by exposure during
many days to the sun or before a hot fire.</p>

<p>In this table we see that castings which had been ejected at
the mouth of the same burrow, and which in most cases appeared
fresh and always retained their vermiform configuration,
generally exceeded an ounce in weight after being dried, and
sometimes nearly equalled a quarter of a pound.&nbsp; On the
Nilgiri mountains one casting even exceeded this latter
weight.&nbsp; The largest castings in England were found on
extremely poor pasture-land; and these, as far as I have seen,
are generally larger than those on land producing a rich
vegetation.&nbsp; It would appear that worms have to swallow a
greater amount of earth on poor than on rich land, in order to
obtain sufficient nutriment.</p>
<p>With respect to the tower-like castings near Nice (Nos. 5 and
6 in the above table), Dr. King often found five or six of them
on a square foot of surface; and these, judging from their
average weight, would have weighed together 7&frac12; ounces; so
that the weight of those on a square yard would have been 4 lb.
3&frac12; oz.&nbsp; Dr. King collected, near the close of the
year 1872, all the castings which still retained their vermiform
shape, whether broken down or not, from a square foot, in a place
abounding with worms, on the summit of a bank, where no castings
could have rolled down from above.&nbsp; These castings must have
been ejected, as he judged from their appearance in reference to
the rainy and dry periods near Nice, within the previous five or
six months; they weighed 9&frac12; oz., or 5 lb. 5&frac12; oz.
per square yard.&nbsp; After an interval of four months, Dr. King
collected all the castings subsequently ejected on the same
square foot of surface, and they weighed 2&frac12; oz., or 1 lb.
6&frac12; oz. per square yard.&nbsp; Therefore within about ten
months, or we will say for safety&rsquo;s sake within a year, 12
oz. of castings were thrown up on this one square foot, or 6.75
pounds on the square yard; and this would give 14.58 tons per
acre.</p>
<p>In a field at the bottom of a valley in the chalk (see No. 2
in the foregoing table), a square yard was measured at a spot
where very large castings abounded; they appeared, however,
almost equally numerous in a few other places.&nbsp; These
castings, which retained perfectly their vermiform shape, were
collected; and they weighed when partially dried, 1 lb.
13&frac12; oz.&nbsp; This field had been rolled with a heavy
agricultural roller fifty-two days before, and this would
certainly have flattened every single casting on the land.&nbsp;
The weather had been very dry for two or three weeks before the
day of collection, so that not one casting appeared fresh or had
been recently ejected.&nbsp; We may therefore assume that those
which were weighed had been ejected within, we will say, forty
days from the time when the field was rolled,&mdash;that is,
twelve days short of the whole intervening period.&nbsp; I had
examined the same part of the field shortly before it was rolled,
and it then abounded with fresh castings.&nbsp; Worms do not work
in dry weather during the summer, or in winter during severe
frosts.&nbsp; If we assume that they work for only half the
year&mdash;though this is too low an estimate&mdash;then the
worms in this field would eject during the year, 8.387 pounds per
square yard; or 18.12 tons per acre, assuming the whole surface
to be equally productive in castings.</p>
<p>In the foregoing cases some of the necessary data had to be
estimated, but in the two following cases the results are much
more trustworthy.&nbsp; A lady, on whose accuracy I can
implicitly rely, offered to collect during a year all the
castings thrown up on two separate square yards, near Leith Hill
Place, in Surrey.&nbsp; The amount collected was, however,
somewhat less than that originally ejected by the worms; for, as
I have repeatedly observed, a good deal of the finest earth is
washed away, whenever castings are thrown up during or shortly
before heavy rain.&nbsp; Small portions also adhered to the
surrounding blades of grass, and it required too much time to
detach every one of them.</p>
<p>On sandy soil, as in the present instance, castings are liable
to crumble after dry weather, and particles were thus often
lost.&nbsp; The lady also occasionally left home for a week or
two, and at such times the castings must have suffered still
greater loss from exposure to the weather.&nbsp; These losses
were, however, compensated to some extent by the collections
having been made on one of the squares for four days, and on the
other square for two days more than the year.</p>
<p>A space was selected (October 9th, 1870) for one of the
squares on a broad, grass-covered terrace, which had been mowed
and swept during many years.&nbsp; It faced the south, but was
shaded during part of the day by trees.&nbsp; It had been formed
at least a century ago by a great accumulation of small and large
fragments of sandstone, together with some sandy earth, rammed
down level.&nbsp; It is probable that it was at first protected
by being covered with turf.&nbsp; This terrace, judging from the
number of castings on it, was rather unfavourable for the
existence of worms, in comparison with the neighbouring fields
and an upper terrace.&nbsp; It was indeed surprising that as many
worms could live here as were seen; for on digging a hole in this
terrace, the black vegetable mould together with the turf was
only four inches in thickness, beneath which lay the level
surface of light-coloured sandy soil, with many fragments of
sandstone.&nbsp; Before any castings were collected all the
previously existing ones were carefully removed.&nbsp; The last
day&rsquo;s collection was on October 14th, 1871.&nbsp; The
castings were then well dried before a fire; and they weighed
exactly 3&frac12; lbs.&nbsp; This would give for an acre of
similar land 7.56 tons of dry earth annually ejected by
worms.</p>
<p>The second square was marked on unenclosed common land, at a
height of about 700 ft. above the sea, at some little distance
from Leith Hill Tower.&nbsp; The surface was clothed with short,
fine turf, and had never been disturbed by the hand of man.&nbsp;
The spot selected appeared neither particularly favourable nor
the reverse for worms; but I have often noticed that castings are
especially abundant on common land, and this may, perhaps, be
attributed to the poorness of the soil.&nbsp; The vegetable mould
was here between three and four inches in thickness.&nbsp; As
this spot was at some distance from the house where the lady
lived, the castings were not collected at such short intervals of
time as those on the terrace; consequently the loss of fine earth
during rainy weather must have been greater in this than in the
last case.&nbsp; The castings moreover were more sandy, and in
collecting them during dry weather they sometimes crumbled into
dust, and much was thus lost.&nbsp; Therefore it is certain that
the worms brought up to the surface considerably more earth than
that which was collected.&nbsp; The last collection was made on
October 27th, 1871; i.e., 367 days after the square had been
marked out and the surface cleared of all pre-existing
castings.&nbsp; The collected castings, after being well dried,
weighed 7.453 pounds; and this would give, for an acre of the
same kind of land, 16.1 tons of annually ejected dry earth.</p>

<p><i>The thickness of the layer of mould</i>, <i>which castings
ejected during a year would form if uniformly spread
out</i>.&mdash;As we know, from the two last cases in the above
summary, the weight of the dried castings ejected by worms during
a year on a square yard of surface, I wished to learn how thick a
layer of ordinary mould this amount would form if spread
uniformly over a square yard.&nbsp; The dry castings were
therefore broken into small particles, and whilst being placed in
a measure were well shaken and pressed down.&nbsp; Those
collected on the Terrace amounted to 124.77 cubic inches; and
this amount, if spread out over a square yard, would make a layer
0.9627 inch in thickness.&nbsp; Those collected on the Common
amounted to 197.56 cubic inches, and would make a similar layer
0.1524 inch in thickness.</p>
<p>These thicknesses must, however, be corrected, for the
triturated castings, after being well shaken down and pressed,
did not make nearly so compact a mass as vegetable mould, though
each separate particle was very compact.&nbsp; Yet mould is far
from being compact, as is shown by the number of air-bubbles
which rise up when the surface is flooded with water.&nbsp; It is
moreover penetrated by many fine roots.&nbsp; To ascertain
approximately by how much ordinary vegetable mould would be
increased in bulk by being broken up into small particles and
then dried, a thin oblong block of somewhat argillaceous mould
(with the turf pared off) was measured before being broken up,
was well dried and again measured.&nbsp; The drying caused it to
shrink by 1/7 of its original bulk, judging from exterior
measurements alone.&nbsp; It was then triturated and partly
reduced to powder, in the same manner as the castings had been
treated, and its bulk now exceeded (notwithstanding shrinkage
from drying) by 1/16 that of the original block of damp
mould.&nbsp; Therefore the above calculated thickness of the
layer, formed by the castings from the Terrace, after being
damped and spread over a square yard, would have to be reduced by
1/16; and this will reduce the layer to 0.09 of an inch, so that
a layer 0.9 inch in thickness would be formed in the course of
ten years.&nbsp; On the same principle the castings from the
Common would make in the course of a single year a layer 0.1429
inch, or in the course of 10 years 1.429 inch, in
thickness.&nbsp; We may say in round numbers that the thickness
in the former case would amount to nearly 1 inch, and in the
second case to nearly 1&frac12; inch in 10 years.</p>
<p>In order to compare these results with those deduced from the
rates at which small objects left on the surfaces of grass-fields
become buried (as described in the early part of this chapter),
we will give the following summary:&mdash;</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>In these cases (excepting the last) it may be seen that the
amount of earth brought to the surface during 10 years is
somewhat greater than that calculated from the castings which
were actually weighed.&nbsp; This excess may be partly accounted
for by the loss which the weighed castings had previously
undergone through being washed by rain, by the adhesion of
particles to the blades of the surrounding grass, and by their
crumbling when dry.&nbsp; Nor must we overlook other agencies
which in all ordinary cases add to the amount of mould, and which
would not be included in the castings that were collected,
namely, the fine earth brought up to the surface by burrowing
larv&aelig; and insects, especially by ants.&nbsp; The earth
brought up by moles generally has a somewhat different appearance
from vegetable mould; but after a time would not be
distinguishable from it.&nbsp; In dry countries, moreover, the
wind plays an important part in carrying dust from one place to
another, and even in England it must add to the mould on fields
near great roads.&nbsp; But in our country these latter several
agencies appear to be of quite subordinate importance in
comparison with the action of worms.</p>
<p>We have no means of judging how great a weight of earth a
single full-sized worm ejects during a year.&nbsp; Hensen
estimates that 53,767 worms exist in an acre of land; but this is
founded on the number found in gardens, and he believes that only
about half as many live in corn-fields.&nbsp; How many live in
old pasture land is unknown; but if we assume that half the above
number, or 26,886 worms live on such land, then taking from the
previous summary 15 tons as the weight of the castings annually
thrown up on an acre of land, each worm must annually eject 20
ounces.&nbsp; A full-sized casting at the mouth of a single
burrow often exceeds, as we have seen, an ounce in weight; and it
is probable that worms eject more than 20 full-sized castings
during a year.&nbsp; If they eject annually more than 20 ounces,
we may infer that the worms which live in an acre of pasture land
must be less than 26,886 in number.</p>
<p>Worms live chiefly in the superficial mould, which is usually
from 4 or 5 to 10 and even 12 inches in thickness; and it is this
mould which passes over and over again through their bodies and
is brought to the surface.&nbsp; But worms occasionally burrow
into the subsoil to a much greater depth, and on such occasions
they bring up earth from this greater depth; and this process has
gone on for countless ages.&nbsp; Therefore the superficial layer
of mould would ultimately attain, though at a slower and slower
rate, a thickness equal to the depth to which worms ever burrow,
were there not other opposing agencies at work which carry away
to a lower level some of the finest earth which is continually
being brought to the surface by worms.&nbsp; How great a
thickness vegetable mould ever attains, I have not had good
opportunities for observing; but in the next chapter, when we
consider the burial of ancient buildings, some facts will be
given on this head.&nbsp; In the two last chapters we shall see
that the soil is actually increased, though only to a small
degree, through the agency of worms; but their chief work is to
sift the finer from the coarser particles, to mingle the whole
with vegetable d&eacute;bris, and to saturate it with their

<p>Finally, no one who considers the facts given in this
chapter&mdash;on the burying of small objects and on the sinking
of great stones left on the surface&mdash;on the vast number of
worms which live within a moderate extent of ground on the weight
of the castings ejected from the mouth of the same
burrow&mdash;on the weight of all the castings ejected within a
known time on a measured space&mdash;will hereafter, as I
believe, doubt that worms play an important part in nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arch&aelig;ologists</span> are probably
not aware how much they owe to worms for the preservation of many
ancient objects.&nbsp; Coins, gold ornaments, stone implements,
&amp;c., if dropped on the surface of the ground, will infallibly
be buried by the castings of worms in a few years, and will thus
be safely preserved, until the land at some future time is turned
up.&nbsp; For instance, many years ago a grass-field was ploughed
on the northern side of the Severn, not far from Shrewsbury; and
a surprising number of iron arrow-heads were found at the bottom
of the furrows, which, as Mr. Blakeway, a local antiquary,
believed, were relics of the battle of Shrewsbury in the year
1403, and no doubt had been originally left strewed on the
battle-field.&nbsp; In the present chapter I shall show that not
only implements, &amp;c., are thus preserved, but that the floors
and the remains of many ancient buildings in England have been
buried so effectually, in large part through the action of worms,
that they have been discovered in recent times solely through
various accidents.&nbsp; The enormous beds of rubbish, several
yards in thickness, which underlie many cities, such as Rome,
Paris, and London, the lower ones being of great antiquity, are
not here referred to, as they have not been in any way acted on
by worms.&nbsp; When we consider how much matter is daily brought
into a great city for building, fuel, clothing and food, and that
in old times when the roads were bad and the work of the
scavenger was neglected, a comparatively small amount was carried
away, we may agree with &Eacute;lie de Beaumont, who, in
discussing this subject, says, &ldquo;pour une voiture de
mat&eacute;riaux qui en sort, on y en fait entrer cent.&rdquo; <a
name="citation166a"></a><a href="#footnote166a"
class="citation">[166a]</a>&nbsp; Nor should we overlook the
effects of fires, the demolition of old buildings, and the
removal of rubbish to the nearest vacant space.</p>
<p><i>Abinger</i>, <i>Surrey</i>.&mdash;Late in the autumn of
1876, the ground in an old farm-yard at this place was dug to a
depth of 2 to 2&frac12; feet, and the workmen found various
ancient remains.&nbsp; This led Mr. T. H. Farrer of Abinger Hall
to have an adjoining ploughed field searched.&nbsp; On a trench
being dug, a layer of concrete, still partly covered with
tesser&aelig; (small red tiles), and surrounded on two sides by
broken-down walls, was soon discovered.&nbsp; It is believed, <a
name="citation166b"></a><a href="#footnote166b"
class="citation">[166b]</a> that this room formed part of the
atrium or reception-room of a Roman villa.&nbsp; The walls of two
or three other small rooms were afterwards discovered.&nbsp; Many
fragments of pottery, other objects, and coins of several Roman
emperors, dating from 133 to 361, and perhaps to 375 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>, were likewise found.&nbsp; Also a
half-penny of George I., 1715.&nbsp; The presence of this latter
coin seems an anomaly; but no doubt it was dropped on the ground
during the last century, and since then there has been ample time
for its burial under a considerable depth of the castings of
worms.&nbsp; From the different dates of the Roman coins we may
infer that the building was long inhabited.&nbsp; It was probably
ruined and deserted 1400 or 1500 years ago.</p>
<p>I was present during the commencement of the excavations
(August 20, 1877) and Mr. Farrer had two deep trenches dug at
opposite ends of the atrium, so that I might examine the nature
of the soil near the remains.&nbsp; The field sloped from east to
west at an angle of about 7&deg;; and one of the two trenches,
shown in the accompanying section (Fig. 8) was at the upper or
eastern end.&nbsp; The diagram is on a scale of 1/20 of an inch
to an inch; but the trench, which was between 4 and 5 feet broad,
and in parts above 5 feet deep, has necessarily been reduced out
of all proportion.&nbsp; The fine mould over the floor of the
atrium varied in thickness from 11 to 16 inches; and on the side
of the trench in the section was a little over 13 inches.&nbsp;
After the mould had been removed, the floor appeared as a whole
moderately level; but it sloped in parts at an angle of 1&deg;,
and in one place near the outside at as much as 8&deg;
30&prime;.&nbsp; The wall surrounding the pavement was built of
rough stones, and was 23 inches in thickness where the trench was
dug.&nbsp; Its broken summit was here 13 inches, but in another
part 15 inches, beneath the surface of the field, being covered
by this thickness of mould.&nbsp; In one spot, however, it rose
to within 6 inches of the surface.&nbsp; On two sides of the
room, where the junction of the concrete floor with the bounding
walls could be carefully examined, there was no crack or
separation.&nbsp; This trench afterwards proved to have been dug
within an adjoining room (11 ft. by 11 ft. 6 in. in size), the
existence of which was not even suspected whilst I was
present.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On the side of the trench farthest from the buried wall (W),
the mould varied from 9 to 14 inches in thickness; it rested on a
mass (B) 23 inches thick of blackish earth, including many large
stones.&nbsp; Beneath this was a thin bed of very black mould
(C), then a layer of earth full of fragments of mortar (D), and
then another thin bed (about 3 inches thick) (E) of very black
mould, which rested on the undisturbed subsoil (F) of firm,
yellowish, argillaceous sand.&nbsp; The 23-inch bed (B) was
probably made ground, as this would have brought up the floor of
the room to a level with that of the atrium.&nbsp; The two thin
beds of black mould at the bottom of the trench evidently marked
two former land-surfaces.&nbsp; Outside the walls of the northern
room, many bones, ashes, oyster-shells, broken pottery and an
entire pot were subsequently found at a depth of 16 inches
beneath the surface.</p>
<p>The second trench was dug on the western or lower side of the
villa: the mould was here only 6&frac12; inches in thickness, and
it rested on a mass of fine earth full of stones, broken tiles
and fragments of mortar, 34 inches in thickness, beneath which
was the undisturbed sand.&nbsp; Most of this earth had probably
been washed down from the upper part of the field, and the
fragments of stones, tiles, &amp;c., must have come from the
immediately adjoining ruins.</p>
<p>It appears at first sight a surprising fact that this field of
light sandy soil should have been cultivated and ploughed during
many years, and that not a vestige of these buildings should have
been discovered.&nbsp; No one even suspected that the remains of
a Roman villa lay hidden close beneath the surface.&nbsp; But the
fact is less surprising when it is known that the field, as the
bailiff believed, had never been ploughed to a greater depth than
4 inches.&nbsp; It is certain that when the land was first
ploughed, the pavement and the surrounding broken walls must have
been covered by at least 4 inches of soil, for otherwise the
rotten concrete floor would have been scored by the ploughshare,
the tesser&aelig; torn up, and the tops of the old walls knocked
down.</p>
<p>When the concrete and tesser&aelig; were first cleared over a
space of 14 by 9 ft., the floor which was coated with
trodden-down earth exhibited no signs of having been penetrated
by worms; and although the overlying fine mould closely resembled
that which in many places has certainly been accumulated by
worms, yet it seemed hardly possible that this mould could have
been brought up by worms from beneath the apparently sound
floor.&nbsp; It seemed also extremely improbable that the thick
walls, surrounding the room and still united to the concrete, had
been undermined by worms, and had thus been caused to sink, being
afterwards covered up by their castings.&nbsp; I therefore at
first concluded that all the fine mould above the ruins had been
washed down from the upper parts of the field; but we shall soon
see that this conclusion was certainly erroneous, though much
fine earth is known to be washed down from the upper part of the
field in its present ploughed state during heavy rains.</p>
<p>Although the concrete floor did not at first appear to have
been anywhere penetrated by worms, yet by the next morning little
cakes of the trodden-down earth had been lifted up by worms over
the mouths of seven burrows, which passed through the softer
parts of the naked concrete, or between the interstices of the
tesser&aelig;.&nbsp; On the third morning twenty-five burrows
were counted; and by suddenly lifting up the little cakes of
earth, four worms were seen in the act of quickly
retreating.&nbsp; Two castings were thrown up during the third
night on the floor, and these were of large size.&nbsp; The
season was not favourable for the full activity of worms, and the
weather had lately been hot and dry, so that most of the worms
now lived at a considerable depth.&nbsp; In digging the two
trenches many open burrows and some worms were encountered at
between 30 and 40 inches beneath the surface; but at a greater
depth they became rare.&nbsp; One worm, however, was cut through
at 48&frac12;, and another at 51&frac12; inches beneath the
surface.&nbsp; A fresh humus-lined burrow was also met with at a
depth of 57 and another at 65&frac12; inches.&nbsp; At greater
depths than this, neither burrows nor worms were seen.</p>
<p>As I wished to learn how many worms lived beneath the floor of
the atrium&mdash;a space of about 14 by 9 feet&mdash;Mr. Farrer
was so kind as to make observations for me, during the next seven
weeks, by which time the worms in the surrounding country were in
full activity, and were working near the surface.&nbsp; It is
very improbable that worms should have migrated from the
adjoining field into the small space of the atrium, after the
superficial mould in which they prefer to live, had been
removed.&nbsp; We may therefore conclude that the burrows and the
castings which were seen here during the ensuing seven weeks were
the work of the former inhabitants of the space.&nbsp; I will now
give a few extracts from Mr. Farrer&rsquo;s notes.</p>
<p>Aug. 26th, 1877; that is, five days after the floor had been
cleared.&nbsp; On the previous night there had been some heavy
rain, which washed the surface clean, and now the mouths of forty
burrows were counted.&nbsp; Parts of the concrete were seen to be
solid, and had never been penetrated by worms, and here the
rain-water lodged.</p>
<p>Sept. 5th.&mdash;Tracks of worms, made during the previous
night, could be seen on the surface of the floor, and five or six
vermiform castings had been thrown up.&nbsp; These were
defaced.</p>
<p>Sept. 12th.&mdash;During the last six days, the worms have not
been active, though many castings have been ejected in the
neighbouring fields; but on this day the earth was a little
raised over the mouths of the burrows, or castings were ejected,
at ten fresh points.&nbsp; These were defaced.&nbsp; It should be
understood that when a fresh burrow is spoken of, this generally
means only that an old burrow has been re-opened.&nbsp; Mr.
Farrer was repeatedly struck with the pertinacity with which the
worms re-opened their old burrows, even when no earth was ejected
from them.&nbsp; I have often observed the same fact, and
generally the mouths of the burrows are protected by an
accumulation of pebbles, sticks or leaves.&nbsp; Mr. Farrer
likewise observed that the worms living beneath the floor of the
atrium often collected coarse grains of sand, and such little
stones as they could find, round the mouths of their burrows.</p>
<p>Sept. 13th; soft wet weather.&nbsp; The mouths of the burrows
were re-opened, or castings were ejected, at 31 points; these
were all defaced.</p>
<p>Sept. 14th; 34 fresh holes or castings; all defaced.</p>
<p>Sept. 15th; 44 fresh holes, only 5 castings; all defaced.</p>
<p>Sept. 18th; 43 fresh holes, 8 castings; all defaced.</p>
<p>The number of castings on the surrounding fields was now very
large.</p>
<p>Sept. 19th; 40 holes, 8 castings; all defaced.</p>
<p>Sept. 22nd; 43 holes, only a few fresh castings; all
defaced.</p>
<p>Sept. 23rd; 44 holes, 8 castings.</p>
<p>Sept. 25th; 50 holes, no record of the number of castings.</p>
<p>Oct. 13th;&nbsp; 61 holes, no record of the number of
castings.</p>
<p>After an interval of three years, Mr. Farrer, at my request,
again looked at the concrete floor, and found the worms still at
work.</p>
<p>Knowing what great muscular power worms possess, and seeing
how soft the concrete was in many parts, I was not surprised at
its having been penetrated by their burrows; but it is a more
surprising fact that the mortar between the rough stones of the
thick walls, surrounding the rooms, was found by Mr. Farrer to
have been penetrated by worms.&nbsp; On August 26th, that is,
five days after the ruins had been exposed, he observed four open
burrows on the broken summit of the eastern wall (W in Fig. 8);
and, on September 15th, other burrows similarly situated were
seen.&nbsp; It should also be noted that in the perpendicular
side of the trench (which was much deeper than is represented in
Fig. 8) three recent burrows were seen, which ran obliquely far
down beneath the base of the old wall.</p>
<p>We thus see that many worms lived beneath the floor and the
walls of the atrium at the time when the excavations were made;
and that they afterwards almost daily brought up earth to the
surface from a considerable depth.&nbsp; There is not the
slightest reason to doubt that worms have acted in this manner
ever since the period when the concrete was sufficiently decayed
to allow them to penetrate it; and even before that period they
would have lived beneath the floor, as soon as it became pervious
to rain, so that the soil beneath was kept damp.&nbsp; The floor
and the walls must therefore have been continually undermined;
and fine earth must have been heaped on them during many
centuries, perhaps for a thousand years.&nbsp; If the burrows
beneath the floor and walls, which it is probable were formerly
as numerous as they now are, had not collapsed in the course of
time in the manner formerly explained, the underlying earth would
have been riddled with passages like a sponge; and as this was
not the case, we may feel sure that they have collapsed.&nbsp;
The inevitable result of such collapsing during successive
centuries, will have been the slow subsidence of the floor and of
the walls, and their burial beneath the accumulated
worm-castings.&nbsp; The subsidence of a floor, whilst it still
remains nearly horizontal, may at first appear improbable; but
the case presents no more real difficulty than that of loose
objects strewed on the surface of a field, which, as we have
seen, become buried several inches beneath the surface in the
course of a few years, though still forming a horizontal layer
parallel to the surface.&nbsp; The burial of the paved and level
path on my lawn, which took place under my own observation, is an
analogous case.&nbsp; Even those parts of the concrete floor
which the worms could not penetrate would almost certainly have
been undermined, and would have sunk, like the great stones at
Leith Hill Place and Stonehenge, for the soil would have been
damp beneath them.&nbsp; But the rate of sinking of the different
parts would not have been quite equal, and the floor was not
quite level.&nbsp; The foundations of the boundary walls lie, as
shown in the section, at a very small depth beneath the surface;
they would therefore have tended to subside at nearly the same
rate as the floor.&nbsp; But this would not have occurred if the
foundations had been deep, as in the case of some other Roman
ruins presently to be described.</p>
<p>Finally, we may infer that a large part of the fine vegetable
mould, which covered the floor and the broken-down walls of this
villa, in some places to a thickness of 16 inches, was brought up
from below by worms.&nbsp; From facts hereafter to be given there
can be no doubt that some of the finest earth thus brought up
will have been washed down the sloping surface of the field
during every heavy shower of rain.&nbsp; If this had not occurred
a greater amount of mould would have accumulated over the ruins
than that now present.&nbsp; But beside the castings of worms and
some earth brought up by insects, and some accumulation of dust,
much fine earth will have been washed over the ruins from the
upper parts of the field, since it has been under cultivation;
and from over the ruins to the lower parts of the slope; the
present thickness of the mould being the resultant of these
several agencies.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I may here append a modern instance of the sinking of a
pavement, communicated to me in 1871 by Mr. Ramsay, Director of
the Geological Survey of England.&nbsp; A passage without a roof,
7 feet in length by 3 feet 2 inches in width, led from his house
into the garden, and was paved with slabs of Portland
stone.&nbsp; Several of these slabs were 16 inches square, others
larger, and some a little smaller.&nbsp; This pavement had
subsided about 3 inches along the middle of the passage, and two
inches on each side, as could be seen by the lines of cement by
which the slabs had been originally joined to the walls.&nbsp;
The pavement had thus become slightly concave along the middle;
but there was no subsidence at the end close to the house.&nbsp;
Mr. Ramsay could not account for this sinking, until he observed
that castings of black mould were frequently ejected along the
lines of junction between the slabs; and these castings were
regularly swept away.&nbsp; The several lines of junction,
including those with the lateral walls, were altogether 39 feet 2
inches in length.&nbsp; The pavement did not present the
appearance of ever having been renewed, and the house was
believed to have been built about eighty-seven years ago.&nbsp;
Considering all these circumstances, Mr. Ramsay does not doubt
that the earth brought up by the worms since the pavement was
first laid down, or rather since the decay of the mortar allowed
the worms to burrow through it, and therefore within a much
shorter time than the eighty-seven years, has sufficed to cause
the sinking of the pavement to the above amount, except close to
the house, where the ground beneath would have been kept nearly
dry.</p>
<p>Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire.&mdash;This abbey was destroyed by
Henry VIII., and there now remains only a portion of the southern
aisle-wall.&nbsp; It is believed that the king had most of the
stones carried away for building a castle; and it is certain that
they have been removed.&nbsp; The positions of the nave and
transepts were ascertained not long ago by the foundations having
been found; and the place is now marked by stones let into the
ground.&nbsp; Where the abbey formerly stood, there now extends a
smooth grass-covered surface, which resembles in all respects the
rest of the field.&nbsp; The guardian, a very old man, said the
surface had never been levelled in his time.&nbsp; In the year
1853, the Duke of Buccleuch had three holes dug in the turf
within a few yards of one another, at the western end of the
nave; and the old tesselated pavement of the abbey was thus
discovered.&nbsp; These holes were afterwards surrounded by
brickwork, and protected by trap-doors, so that the pavement
might be readily inspected and preserved.&nbsp; When my son
William examined the place on January 5, 1872, he found that the
pavement in the three holes lay at depths of 6&frac34;, 10 and
11&frac12; inches beneath the surrounding turf-covered
surface.&nbsp; The old guardian asserted that he was often forced
to remove worm-castings from the pavement; and that he had done
so about six months before.&nbsp; My son collected all from one
of the holes, the area of which was 5.32 square feet, and they
weighed 7.97 ounces.&nbsp; Assuming that this amount had
accumulated in six months, the accumulation during a year on a
square yard would be 1.68 pounds, which, though a large amount,
is very small compared with what, as we have seen, is often
ejected on fields and commons.&nbsp; When I visited the abbey on
June 22, 1877, the old man said that he had cleared out the holes
about a month before, but a good many castings had since been
ejected.&nbsp; I suspect that he imagined that he swept the
pavements oftener than he really did, for the conditions were in
several respects very unfavourable for the accumulation of even a
moderate amount of castings.&nbsp; The tiles are rather large,
viz., about 5&frac12; inches square, and the mortar between them
was in most places sound, so that the worms were able to bring up
earth from below only at certain points.&nbsp; The tiles rested
on a bed of concrete, and the castings in consequence consisted
in large part (viz., in the proportion of 19 to 33) of particles
of mortar, grains of sand, little fragments of rock, bricks or
tile; and such substances could hardly be agreeable, and
certainly not nutritious, to worms.</p>
<p>My son dug holes in several places within the former walls of
the abbey, at a distance of several yards from the above
described bricked squares.&nbsp; He did not find any tiles,
though these are known to occur in some other parts, but he came
in one spot to concrete on which tiles had once rested.&nbsp; The
fine mould beneath the turf on the sides of the several holes,
varied in thickness from only 2 to 2&frac34; inches, and this
rested on a layer from 8&frac34; to above 11 inches in thickness,
consisting of fragments of mortar and stone-rubbish with the
interstices compactly filled up with black mould.&nbsp; In the
surrounding field, at a distance of 20 yards from the abbey, the
fine vegetable mould was 11 inches thick.</p>
<p>We may conclude from these facts that when the abbey was
destroyed and the stones removed, a layer of rubbish was left
over the whole surface, and that as soon as the worms were able
to penetrate the decayed concrete and the joints between the
tiles, they slowly filled up the interstices in the overlying
rubbish with their castings, which were afterwards accumulated to
a thickness of nearly three inches over the whole surface.&nbsp;
If we add to this latter amount the mould between the fragments
of stones, some five or six inches of mould must have been
brought up from beneath the concrete or tiles.&nbsp; The concrete
or tiles will consequently have subsided to nearly this
amount.&nbsp; The bases of the columns of the aisles are now
buried beneath mould and turf.&nbsp; It is not probable that they
can have been undermined by worms, for their foundations would no
doubt have been laid at a considerable depth.&nbsp; If they have
not subsided, the stones of which the columns were constructed
must have been removed from beneath the former level of the
floor.</p>
<p><i>Chedworth</i>, <i>Gloucestershire</i>.&mdash;The remains of
a large Roman villa were discovered here in 1866, on ground which
had been covered with wood from time immemorial.&nbsp; No
suspicion seems ever to have been entertained that ancient
buildings lay buried here, until a gamekeeper, in digging for
rabbits, encountered some remains. <a name="citation183"></a><a
href="#footnote183" class="citation">[183]</a>&nbsp; But
subsequently the tops of some stone walls were detected in parts
of the wood, projecting a little above the surface of the
ground.&nbsp; Most of the coins found here belonged to Constans
(who died 350 <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>) and the
Constantine family.&nbsp; My sons Francis and Horace visited the
place in November 1877, for the sake of ascertaining what part
worms may have played in the burial of these extensive
remains.&nbsp; But the circumstances were not favourable for this
object, as the ruins are surrounded on three sides by rather
steep banks, down which earth is washed during rainy
weather.&nbsp; Moreover most of the old rooms have been covered
with roofs, for the protection of the elegant tesselated
pavements.</p>
<p>A few facts may, however, be given on the thickness of the
soil over these ruins.&nbsp; Close outside the northern rooms
there is a broken wall, the summit of which was covered by 5
inches of black mould; and in a hole dug on the outer side of
this wall, where the ground had never before been disturbed,
black mould, full of stones, 26 inches in thickness, was found,
resting on the undisturbed sub-soil of yellow clay.&nbsp; At a
depth of 22 inches from the surface a pig&rsquo;s jaw and a
fragment of a tile were found.&nbsp; When the excavations were
first made, some large trees grew over the ruins; and the stump
of one has been left directly over a party-wall near the
bath-room, for the sake of showing the thickness of the
superincumbent soil, which was here 38 inches.&nbsp; In one small
room, which, after being cleared out, had not been roofed over,
my sons observed the hole of a worm passing through the rotten
concrete, and a living worm was found within the concrete.&nbsp;
In another open room worm-castings were seen on the floor, over
which some earth had by this means been deposited, and here grass
now grew.</p>
<p><i>Brading</i>, <i>Isle of Wight</i>.&mdash;A fine Roman villa
was discovered here in 1880; and by the end of October no less
than 18 chambers had been more or less cleared.&nbsp; A coin
dated 337 <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> was found.&nbsp; My
son William visited the place before the excavations were
completed; and he informs me that most of the floors were at
first covered with much rubbish and fallen stones, having their
interstices completely filled up with mould, abounding, as the
workmen said, with worms, above which there was mould without any
stones.&nbsp; The whole mass was in most places from 3 to above 4
ft. in thickness.&nbsp; In one very large room the overlying
earth was only 2 ft. 6 in. thick; and after this had been
removed, so many castings were thrown up between the tiles that
the surface had to be almost daily swept.&nbsp; Most of the
floors were fairly level.&nbsp; The tops of the broken-down walls
were covered in some places by only 4 or 5 inches of soil, so
that they were occasionally struck by the plough, but in other
places they were covered by from 13 to 18 inches of soil.&nbsp;
It is not probable that these walls could have been undermined by
worms and subsided, as they rested on a foundation of very hard
red sand, into which worms could hardly burrow.&nbsp; The mortar,
however, between the stones of the walls of a hypocaust was found
by my son to have been penetrated by many worm-burrows.&nbsp; The
remains of this villa stand on land which slopes at an angle of
about 3&deg;; and the land appears to have been long
cultivated.&nbsp; Therefore no doubt a considerable quantity of
fine earth has been washed down from the upper parts of the
field, and has largely aided in the burial of these remains.</p>
<p><i>Silchester</i>, <i>Hampshire</i>.&mdash;The ruins of this
small Roman town have been better preserved than any other
remains of the kind in England.&nbsp; A broken wall, in most
parts from 15 to 18 feet in height and about 1&frac12; mile in
compass, now surrounds a space of about 100 acres of cultivated
land, on which a farm-house and a church stand. <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a>&nbsp; Formerly, when the weather was
dry, the lines of the buried walls could be traced by the
appearance of the crops; and recently very extensive excavations
have been undertaken by the Duke of Wellington, under the
superintendence of the late Rev. J. G. Joyce, by which means many
large buildings have been discovered.&nbsp; Mr. Joyce made
careful coloured sections, and measured the thickness of each bed
of rubbish, whilst the excavations were in progress; and he has
had the kindness to send me copies of several of them.&nbsp; When
my sons Francis and Horace visited these ruins, he accompanied
them, and added his notes to theirs.</p>
<p>Mr. Joyce estimates that the town was inhabited by the Romans
for about three centuries; and no doubt much matter must have
accumulated within the walls during this long period.&nbsp; It
appears to have been destroyed by fire, and most of the stones
used in the buildings have since been carried away.&nbsp; These
circumstances are unfavourable for ascertaining the part which
worms have played in the burial of the ruins; but as careful
sections of the rubbish overlying an ancient town have seldom or
never before been made in England, I will give copies of the most
characteristic portions of some of those made by Mr. Joyce.&nbsp;
They are of too great length to be here introduced entire.</p>
<p>An east and west section, 30 ft. in length, was made across a
room in the Basilica, now called the Hall of the Merchants (Fig.
9).&nbsp; The hard concrete floor, still covered here and there
with tesser&aelig;, was found at 3 ft. beneath the surface of the
field, which was here level.&nbsp; On the floor there were two
large piles of charred wood, one alone of which is shown in the
part of the section here given.&nbsp; This pile was covered by a
thin white layer of decayed stucco or plaster, above which was a
mass, presenting a singularly disturbed appearance, of broken
tiles, mortar, rubbish and fine gravel, together 27 inches in
thickness.&nbsp; Mr. Joyce believes that the gravel was used in
making the mortar or concrete, which has since decayed, some of
the lime probably having been dissolved.&nbsp; The disturbed
state of the rubbish may have been due to its having been
searched for building stones.&nbsp; This bed was capped by fine
vegetable mould, 9 inches in thickness.&nbsp; From these facts we
may conclude that the Hall was burnt down, and that much rubbish
fell on the floor, through and from which the worms slowly
brought up the mould, now forming the surface of the level
field.</p>

<p>A section across the middle of another hall in the Basilica,
32 feet 6 inches in length, called the &AElig;rarium, is shown in
Fig. 10.&nbsp; It appears that we have here evidence of two
fires, separated by an interval of time, during which the 6
inches of &ldquo;mortar and concrete with broken tiles&rdquo; was
accumulated.&nbsp; Beneath one of the layers of charred wood, a
valuable relic, a bronze eagle, was found; and this shows that
the soldiers must have deserted the place in a panic.&nbsp; Owing
to the death of Mr. Joyce, I have not been able to ascertain
beneath which of the two layers the eagle was found.&nbsp; The
bed of rubble overlying the undisturbed gravel originally formed,
as I suppose, the floor, for it stands on a level with that of a
corridor, outside the walls of the Hall; but the corridor is not
shown in the section as here given.&nbsp; The vegetable mould was
16 inches thick in the thickest part; and the depth from the
surface of the field, clothed with herbage, to the undisturbed
gravel, was 40 inches.</p>

<p>The section shown in Fig. 11 represents an excavation made in
the middle of the town, and is here introduced because the bed of
&ldquo;rich mould&rdquo; attained, according to Mr. Joyce, the
unusual thickness of 20 inches.&nbsp; Gravel lay at the depth of
48 inches from the surface; but it was not ascertained whether
this was in its natural state, or had been brought here and had
been rammed down, as occurs in some other places.</p>

<p>The section shown in Fig. 12 was taken in the centre of the
Basilica, and though it was 5 feet in depth, the natural sub-soil
was not reached.&nbsp; The bed marked &ldquo;concrete&rdquo; was
probably at one time a floor; and the beds beneath seem to be the
remnants of more ancient buildings.&nbsp; The vegetable mould was
here only 9 inches thick.&nbsp; In some other sections, not
copied, we likewise have evidence of buildings having been
erected over the ruins of older ones.&nbsp; In one case there was
a layer of yellow clay of very unequal thickness between two beds
of d&eacute;bris, the lower one of which rested on a floor with
tesser&aelig;.&nbsp; The ancient broken walls appear to have been
sometimes roughly cut down to a uniform level, so as to serve as
the foundations for a temporary building; and Mr. Joyce suspects
that some of these buildings were wattled sheds, plastered with
clay, which would account for the above-mentioned layer of
clay.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Turning now to the points which more immediately concern
us.&nbsp; Worm-castings were observed on the floors of several of
the rooms, in one of which the tesselation was unusually
perfect.&nbsp; The tesser&aelig; here consisted of little cubes
of hard sandstone of about 1 inch, several of which were loose or
projected slightly above the general level.&nbsp; One or
occasionally two open worm-burrows were found beneath all the
loose tesser&aelig;.&nbsp; Worms have also penetrated the old
walls of these ruins.&nbsp; A wall, which had just been exposed
to view during the excavations then in progress, was examined; it
was built of large flints, and was 18 inches in thickness.&nbsp;
It appeared sound, but when the soil was removed from beneath,
the mortar in the lower part was found to be so much decayed that
the flints fell apart from their own weight.&nbsp; Here, in the
middle of the wall, at a depth of 29 inches beneath the old floor
and of 49&frac12; inches beneath the surface of the field, a
living worm was found, and the mortar was penetrated by several
burrows.</p>
<p>A second wall was exposed to view for the first time, and an
open burrow was seen on its broken summit.&nbsp; By separating
the flints this burrow was traced far down in the interior of the
wall; but as some of the flints cohered firmly, the whole mass
was disturbed in pulling down the wall, and the burrow could not
be traced to the bottom.&nbsp; The foundations of a third wall,
which appeared quite sound, lay at a depth of 4 feet beneath one
of the floors, and of course at a considerably greater depth
beneath the level of the ground.&nbsp; A large flint was wrenched
out of the wall at about a foot from the base, and this required
much force, as the mortar was sound; but behind the flint in the
middle of the wall, the mortar was friable, and here there were
worm-burrows.&nbsp; Mr. Joyce and my sons were surprised at the
blackness of the mortar in this and in several other cases, and
at the presence of mould in the interior of the walls.&nbsp; Some
may have been placed there by the old builders instead of mortar;
but we should remember that worms line their burrows with black
humus.&nbsp; Moreover open spaces would almost certainly have
been occasionally left between the large irregular flints; and
these spaces, we may feel sure, would be filled up by the worms
with their castings, as soon as they were able to penetrate the
wall.&nbsp; Rain-water, oozing down the burrows would also carry
fine dark-coloured particles into every crevice.&nbsp; Mr. Joyce
was at first very sceptical about the amount of work which I
attributed to worms; but he ends his notes with reference to the
last-mentioned wall by saying, &ldquo;This case caused me more
surprise and brought more conviction to me than any other.&nbsp;
I should have said, and did say, that it was quite impossible
such a wall could have been penetrated by earth-worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In almost all the rooms the pavement has sunk considerably,
especially towards the middle; and this is shown in the three
following sections.&nbsp; The measurements were made by
stretching a string tightly and horizontally over the
floor.&nbsp; The section, Fig. 13, was taken from north to south
across a room, 18 feet 4 inches in length, with a nearly perfect
pavement, next to the &ldquo;Red Wooden Hut.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
northern half, the subsidence amounted to 5&frac34; inches
beneath the level of the floor as it now stands close to the
walls; and it was greater in the northern than in the southern
half; but, according to Mr. Joyce, the entire pavement has
obviously subsided.&nbsp; In several places, the tesser&aelig;
appeared as if drawn a little away from the walls; whilst in
other places they were still in close contact with them.</p>

"Fig. 14: A north and south section through the subsided floor of

</a></p>
<p>In Fig. 14, we see a section across the paved floor of the
southern corridor or ambulatory of a quadrangle, in an excavation
made near &ldquo;The Spring.&rdquo;&nbsp; The floor is 7 feet 9
inches wide, and the broken-down walls now project only &frac34;
of an inch above its level.&nbsp; The field, which was in
pasture, here sloped from north to south, at an angle of 30&deg;,
40&prime;.&nbsp; The nature of the ground at some little distance
on each side of the corridor is shown in the section.&nbsp; It
consisted of earth full of stones and other d&eacute;bris, capped
with dark vegetable mould which was thicker on the lower or
southern than on the northern side.&nbsp; The pavement was nearly
level along lines parallel to the side-walls, but had sunk in the
middle as much as 7&frac34; inches.</p>
<p>A small room at no great distance from that represented in
Fig. 13, had been enlarged by the Roman occupier on the southern
side, by an addition of 5 feet 4 inches in breadth.&nbsp; For
this purpose the southern wall of the house had been pulled down,
but the foundations of the old wall had been left buried at a
little depth beneath the pavement of the enlarged room.&nbsp; Mr.
Joyce believes that this buried wall must have been built before
the reign of Claudius II., who died 270 <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>&nbsp; We see in the accompanying
section, Fig. 15, that the tesselated pavement has subsided to a
less degree over the buried wall than elsewhere; so that a slight
convexity or protuberance here stretched in a straight line
across the room.&nbsp; This led to a hole being dug, and the
buried wall was thus discovered.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>We see in these three sections, and in several others not
given, that the old pavements have sunk or sagged
considerably.&nbsp; Mr. Joyce formerly attributed this sinking
solely to the slow settling of the ground.&nbsp; That there has
been some settling is highly probable, and it may be seen in Fig.
15 that the pavement for a width of 5 feet over the southern
enlargement of the room, which must have been built on fresh
ground, has sunk a little more than on the old northern
side.&nbsp; But this sinking may possibly have had no connection
with the enlargement of the room; for in Fig. 13 one half of the
pavement has subsided more than the other half without any
assignable cause.&nbsp; In a bricked passage to Mr. Joyce&rsquo;s
own house, laid down only about six years ago, the same kind of
sinking has occurred as in the ancient buildings.&nbsp;
Nevertheless it does not appear probable that the whole amount of
sinking can be thus accounted for.&nbsp; The Roman builders
excavated the ground to an unusual depth for the foundations of
their walls, which were thick and solid; it is therefore hardly
credible that they should have been careless about the solidity
of the bed on which their tesselated and often ornamented
pavements were laid.&nbsp; The sinking must, as it appears to me,
be attributed in chief part to the pavement having been
undermined by worms, which we know are still at work.&nbsp; Even
Mr. Joyce at last admitted that this could not have failed to
have produced a considerable effect.&nbsp; Thus also the large
quantity of fine mould overlying the pavements can be accounted
for, the presence of which would otherwise be inexplicable.&nbsp;
My sons noticed that in one room in which the pavement had sagged
very little, there was an unusually small amount of overlying
mould.</p>
<p>As the foundations of the walls generally lie at a
considerable depth, they will either have not subsided at all
through the undermining action of worms, or they will have
subsided much less than the floor.&nbsp; This latter result would
follow from worms not often working deep down beneath the
foundations; but more especially from the walls not yielding when
penetrated by worms, whereas the successively formed burrows in a
mass of earth, equal to one of the walls in depth and thickness,
would have collapsed many times since the desertion of the ruins,
and would consequently have shrunk or subsided.&nbsp; As the
walls cannot have sunk much or at all, the immediately adjoining
pavement from adhering to them will have been prevented from
subsiding; and thus the present curvature of the pavement is
intelligible.</p>
<p>The circumstance which has surprised me most with respect to
Silchester is that during the many centuries which have elapsed
since the old buildings were deserted, the vegetable mould has
not accumulated over them to a greater thickness than that here
observed.&nbsp; In most places it is only about 9 inches in
thickness, but in some places 12 or even more inches.&nbsp; In
Fig. 11, it is given as 20 inches, but this section was drawn by
Mr. Joyce before his attention was particularly called to this
subject.&nbsp; The land enclosed within the old walls is
described as sloping slightly to the south; but there are parts
which, according to Mr. Joyce, are nearly level, and it appears
that the mould is here generally thicker than elsewhere.&nbsp;
The surface slopes in other parts from west to east, and Mr.
Joyce describes one floor as covered at the western end by
rubbish and mould to a thickness of 28&frac12; inches, and at the
eastern end by a thickness of only 11&frac12; inches.&nbsp; A
very slight slope suffices to cause recent castings to flow
downwards during heavy rain, and thus much earth will ultimately
reach the neighbouring rills and streams and be carried
away.&nbsp; By this means, the absence of very thick beds of
mould over these ancient ruins may, as I believe, be
explained.&nbsp; Moreover most of the land here has long been
ploughed, and this would greatly aid the washing away of the
finer earth during rainy weather.</p>
<p>The nature of the beds immediately beneath the vegetable mould
in some of the sections is rather perplexing.&nbsp; We see, for
instance, in the section of an excavation in a grass meadow (Fig.
14), which sloped from north to south at an angle of 3&deg;
40&prime;, that the mould on the upper side is only six inches
and on the lower side nine inches in thickness.&nbsp; But this
mould lies on a mass (25&frac12; inches in thickness on the upper
side) &ldquo;of dark brown mould,&rdquo; as described by Mr.
Joyce, &ldquo;thickly interspersed with small pebbles and bits of
tiles, which present a corroded or worn appearance.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The state of this dark-coloured earth is like that of a field
which has long been ploughed, for the earth thus becomes
intermingled with stones and fragments of all kinds which have
been much exposed to the weather.&nbsp; If during the course of
many centuries this grass meadow and the other now cultivated
fields have been at times ploughed, and at other times left as
pasture, the nature of the ground in the above section is
rendered intelligible.&nbsp; For worms will continually have
brought up fine earth from below, which will have been stirred up
by the plough whenever the land was cultivated.&nbsp; But after a
time a greater thickness of fine earth will thus have been
accumulated than could be reached by the plough; and a bed like
the 25&frac12;-inch mass, in Fig. 14, will have been formed
beneath the superficial mould, which latter will have been
brought to the surface within more recent times, and have been
well sifted by the worms.</p>
<p><i>Wroxeter</i>, <i>Shropshire</i>.&mdash;The old Roman city
of Uriconium was founded in the early part of the second century,
if not before this date; and it was destroyed, according to Mr.
Wright, probably between the middle of the fourth and fifth
century.&nbsp; The inhabitants were massacred, and skeletons of
women were found in the hypocausts.&nbsp; Before the year 1859,
the sole remnant of the city above ground, was a portion of a
massive wall about 20 ft. in height.&nbsp; The surrounding land
undulates slightly, and has long been under cultivation.&nbsp; It
had been noticed that the corn-crops ripened prematurely in
certain narrow lines, and that the snow remained unmelted in
certain places longer than in others.&nbsp; These appearances
led, as I was informed, to extensive excavations being
undertaken.&nbsp; The foundations of many large buildings and
several streets have thus been exposed to view.&nbsp; The space
enclosed within the old walls is an irregular oval, about
1&frac34; mile in length.&nbsp; Many of the stones or bricks used
in the buildings must have been carried away; but the hypocausts,
baths, and other underground buildings were found tolerably
perfect, being filled with stones, broken tiles, rubbish and
soil.&nbsp; The old floors of various rooms were covered with
rubble.&nbsp; As I was anxious to know how thick the mantle of
mould and rubbish was, which had so long concealed these ruins, I
applied to Dr. H. Johnson, who had superintended the excavations;
and he, with the greatest kindness, twice visited the place to
examine it in reference to my questions, and had many trenches
dug in four fields which had hitherto been undisturbed.&nbsp; The
results of his observations are given in the following
Table.&nbsp; He also sent me specimens of the mould, and
answered, as far as he could, all my questions.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson distinguished as mould the earth which differed,
more or less abruptly, in its dark colour and in its texture from
the underlying sand or rubble.&nbsp; In the specimens sent to me,
the mould resembled that which lies immediately beneath the turf
in old pasture-land, excepting that it often contained small
stones, too large to have passed through the bodies of
worms.&nbsp; But the trenches above described were dug in fields,
none of which were in pasture, and all had been long
cultivated.&nbsp; Bearing in mind the remarks made in reference
to Silchester on the effects of long-continued culture, combined
with the action of worms in bringing up the finer particles to
the surface, the mould, as so designated by Dr. Johnson, seems
fairly well to deserve its name.&nbsp; Its thickness, where there
was no causeway, floor or walls beneath, was greater than has
been elsewhere observed, namely, in many places above 2 ft., and
in one spot above 3 ft.&nbsp; The mould was thickest on and close
to the nearly level summit of the field called &ldquo;Shop
Leasows,&rdquo; and in a small adjoining field, which, as I
believe, is of nearly the same height.&nbsp; One side of the
former field slopes at an angle of rather above 2&deg;, and I
should have expected that the mould, from being washed down
during heavy rain, would have been thicker in the lower than in
the upper part; but this was not the case in two out of the three
trenches here dug.</p>
<p>In many places, where streets ran beneath the surface, or
where old buildings stood, the mould was only 8 inches in
thickness; and Dr. Johnson was surprised that in ploughing the
land, the ruins had never been struck by the plough as far as he
had heard.&nbsp; He thinks that when the land was first
cultivated the old walls were perhaps intentionally pulled down,
and that hollow places were filled up.&nbsp; This may have been
the case; but if after the desertion of the city the land was
left for many centuries uncultivated, worms would have brought up
enough fine earth to have covered the ruins completely; that is
if they had subsided from having been undermined.&nbsp; The
foundations of some of the walls, for instance those of the
portion still standing about 20 feet above the ground, and those
of the marketplace, lie at the extraordinary depth of 14 feet;
but it is highly improbable that the foundations were generally
so deep.&nbsp; The mortar employed in the buildings must have
been excellent, for it is still in parts extremely hard.&nbsp;
Wherever walls of any height have been exposed to view, they are,
as Dr. Johnson believes, still perpendicular.&nbsp; The walls
with such deep foundations cannot have been undermined by worms,
and therefore cannot have subsided, as appears to have occurred
at Abinger and Silchester.&nbsp; Hence it is very difficult to
account for their being now completely covered with earth; but
how much of this covering consists of vegetable mould and how
much of rubble I do not know.&nbsp; The market-place, with the
foundations at a depth of 14 feet, was covered up, as Dr. Johnson
believes, by between 6 and 24 inches of earth.&nbsp; The tops of
the broken-down walls of a caldarium or bath, 9 feet in depth,
were likewise covered up with nearly 2 feet of earth.&nbsp; The
summit of an arch, leading into an ash-pit 7 feet in depth, was
covered up with not more than 8 inches of earth.&nbsp; Whenever a
building which has not subsided is covered with earth, we must
suppose, either that the upper layers of stone have been at some
time carried away by man, or that earth has since been washed
down during heavy rain, or blown down during storms, from the
adjoining land; and this would be especially apt to occur where
the land has long been cultivated.&nbsp; In the above cases the
adjoining land is somewhat higher than the three specified sites,
as far as I can judge by maps and from information given me by
Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; If; however, a great pile of broken stones,
mortar, plaster, timber and ashes fell over the remains of any
building, their disintegration in the course of time, and the
sifting action of worms, would ultimately conceal the whole
beneath fine earth.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Conclusion</i>.&mdash;The cases given in this chapter show
that worms have played a considerable part in the burial and
concealment of several Roman and other old buildings in England;
but no doubt the washing down of soil from the neighbouring
higher lands, and the deposition of dust, have together aided
largely in the work of concealment.&nbsp; Dust would be apt to
accumulate wherever old broken-down walls projected a little
above the then existing surface and thus afforded some
shelter.&nbsp; The floors of the old rooms, halls and passages
have generally sunk, partly from the settling of the ground, but
chiefly from having been undermined by worms; and the sinking has
commonly been greater in the middle than near the walls.&nbsp;
The walls themselves, whenever their foundations do not lie at a
great depth, have been penetrated and undermined by worms, and
have consequently subsided.&nbsp; The unequal subsidence thus
caused, probably explains the great cracks which may be seen in
many ancient walls, as well as their inclination from the
perpendicular.</p>

triturating power of worms not quite insignificant under a
geological point of view.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one doubts that our world at one
time consisted of crystalline rocks, and that it is to their
disintegration through the action of air, water, changes of
temperature, rivers, waves of the sea, earthquakes and volcanic
outbursts, that we owe our sedimentary formations.&nbsp; These
after being consolidated and sometimes recrystallized, have often
been again disintegrated.&nbsp; Denudation means the removal of
such disintegrated matter to a lower level.&nbsp; Of the many
striking results due to the modern progress of geology there are
hardly any more striking than those which relate to
denudation.&nbsp; It was long ago seen that there must have been
an immense amount of denudation; but until the successive
formations were carefully mapped and measured, no one fully
realised how great was the amount.&nbsp; One of the first and
most remarkable memoirs ever published on this subject was that
by Ramsay, <a name="citation210"></a><a href="#footnote210"
class="citation">[210]</a> who in 1846 showed that in Wales from
9000 to 11,000 feet in thickness of solid rock had been stripped
off large tracks of country.&nbsp; Perhaps the plainest evidence
of great denudation is afforded by faults or cracks, which extend
for many miles across certain districts, with the strata on one
side raised even ten thousand feet above the corresponding strata
on the opposite side; and yet there is not a vestige of this
gigantic displacement visible on the surface of the land.&nbsp; A
huge pile of rock has been planed away on one side and not a
remnant left.</p>
<p>Until the last twenty or thirty years, most geologists thought
that the waves of the sea were the chief agents in the work of
denudation; but we may now feel sure that air and rain, aided by
streams and rivers, are much more powerful agents,&mdash;that is
if we consider the whole area of the land.&nbsp; The long lines
of escarpment which stretch across several parts of England were
formerly considered to be undoubtedly ancient coast-lines; but we
now know that they stand up above the general surface merely from
resisting air, rain and frost better than the adjoining
formations.&nbsp; It has rarely been the good fortune of a
geologist to bring conviction to the minds of his fellow-workers
on a disputed point by a single memoir; but Mr. Whitaker, of the
Geological Survey of England, was so fortunate when, in 1867, he
published his paper &ldquo;On sub-aerial Denudation, and on
Cliffs and Escarpments of the Chalk.&rdquo; <a
name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a>&nbsp; Before this paper appeared, Mr.
A. Tylor had adduced important evidence on sub-aerial denudation,
by showing that the amount of matter brought down by rivers must
infallibly lower the level of their drainage basins by many feet
in no immense lapse of time.&nbsp; This line of argument has
since been followed up in the most interesting manner by
Archibald Geikie, Croll and others, in a series of valuable
memoirs. <a name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212"
class="citation">[212]</a>&nbsp; For the sake of those who have
never attended to this subject, a single instance may be here
given, namely, that of the Mississippi, which is chosen because
the amount of sediment brought down by this great river has been
investigated with especial care by order of the United States
Government.&nbsp; The result is, as Mr. Croll shows, that the
mean level of its enormous area of drainage must be lowered
1/4566 of a foot annually, or 1 foot in 4566 years.&nbsp;
Consequently, taking the best estimate of the mean height of the
North American continent, viz. 748 feet, and looking to the
future, the whole of the great Mississippi basin will be washed
away, and &ldquo;brought down to the sea-level in less than
4,500,000 years, if no elevation of the land takes
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some rivers carry down much more sediment
relatively to their size, and some much less than the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>Disintegrated matter is carried away by the wind as well as by
running water.&nbsp; During volcanic outbursts much rock is
triturated and is thus widely dispersed; and in all arid
countries the wind plays an important part in the removal of such
matter.&nbsp; Wind-driven sand also wears down the hardest
rocks.&nbsp; I have shown <a name="citation213"></a><a
href="#footnote213" class="citation">[213]</a> that during four
months of the year a large quantity of dust is blown from the
north-western shores of Africa, and falls on the Atlantic over a
space of 1600 miles in latitude, and for a distance of from 300
to 600 miles from the coast.&nbsp; But dust has been seen to fall
at a distance of 1030 miles from the shores of Africa.&nbsp;
During a stay of three weeks at St. Jago in the Cape Verde
Archipelago, the atmosphere was almost always hazy, and extremely
fine dust coming from Africa was continually falling.&nbsp; In
some of this dust which fell in the open ocean at a distance of
between 330 and 380 miles from the African coast, there were many
particles of stone, about 1/1000 of an inch square.&nbsp; Nearer
to the coast the water has been seen to be so much discoloured by
the falling dust, that a sailing vessel left a track behind
her.&nbsp; In countries, like the Cape Verde Archipelago, where
it seldom rains and there are no frosts, the solid rock
nevertheless disintegrates; and in conformity with the views
lately advanced by a distinguished Belgian geologist, De Koninck,
such disintegration may be attributed in chief part to the action
of the carbonic and nitric acids, together with the nitrates and
nitrites of ammonia, dissolved in the dew.</p>
<p>In all humid, even moderately humid, countries, worms aid in
the work of denudation in several ways.&nbsp; The vegetable mould
which covers, as with a mantle, the surface of the land, has all
passed many times through their bodies.&nbsp; Mould differs in
appearance from the subsoil only in its dark colour, and in the
absence of fragments or particles of stone (when such are present
in the subsoil), larger than those which can pass through the
alimentary canal of a worm.&nbsp; This sifting of the soil is
aided, as has already been remarked, by burrowing animals of many
kinds, especially by ants.&nbsp; In countries where the summer is
long and dry, the mould in protected places must be largely
increased by dust blown from other and more exposed places.&nbsp;
For instance, the quantity of dust sometimes blown over the
plains of La Plata, where there are no solid rocks, is so great,
that during the &ldquo;gran seco,&rdquo; 1827 to 1830, the
appearance of the land, which is here unenclosed, was so
completely changed that the inhabitants could not recognise the
limits of their own estates, and endless lawsuits arose.&nbsp;
Immense quantities of dust are likewise blown about in Egypt and
in the south of France.&nbsp; In China, as Richthofen maintains,
beds appearing like fine sediment, several hundred feet in
thickness and extending over an enormous area, owe their origin
to dust blown from the high lands of central Asia. <a
name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a>&nbsp; In humid countries like Great
Britain, as long as the land remains in its natural state clothed
with vegetation, the mould in any one place can hardly be much
increased by dust; but in its present condition, the fields near
high roads, where there is much traffic, must receive a
considerable amount of dust, and when fields are harrowed during
dry and windy weather, clouds of dust may be seen to be blown
away.&nbsp; But in all these cases the surface-soil is merely
transported from one place to another.&nbsp; The dust which falls
so thickly within our houses consists largely of organic matter,
and if spread over the land would in time decay and disappear
almost entirely.&nbsp; It appears, however, from recent
observations on the snow-fields of the Arctic regions, that some
little meteoric dust of extra mundane origin is continually
falling.</p>
<p>The dark colour of ordinary mould is obviously due to the
presence of decaying organic matter, which, however, is present
in but small quantities.&nbsp; The loss of weight which mould
suffers when heated to redness seems to be in large part due to
water in combination being dispelled.&nbsp; In one sample of
fertile mould the amount of organic matter was ascertained to be
only 1.76 per cent.; in some artificially prepared soil it was as
much as 5.5 per cent., and in the famous black soil of Russia
from 5 to even 12 per cent. <a name="citation217a"></a><a
href="#footnote217a" class="citation">[217a]</a>&nbsp; In
leaf-mould formed exclusively by the decay of leaves the amount
is much greater, and in peat the carbon alone sometimes amounts
to 64 per cent.; but with these latter cases we are not here
concerned.&nbsp; The carbon in the soil tends gradually to
oxidise and to disappear, except where water accumulates and the
climate is cool; <a name="citation217b"></a><a
href="#footnote217b" class="citation">[217b]</a> so that in the
oldest pasture-land there is no great excess of organic matter,
notwithstanding the continued decay of the roots and the
underground stems of plants, and the occasional addition of
manure.&nbsp; The disappearance of the organic matter from mould
is probably much aided by its being brought again and again to
the surface in the castings of worms.</p>
<p>Worms, on the other hand, add largely to the organic matter in
the soil by the astonishing number of half-decayed leaves which
they draw into their burrows to a depth of 2 or 3 inches.&nbsp;
They do this chiefly for obtaining food, but partly for closing
the mouths of their burrows and for lining the upper part.&nbsp;
The leaves which they consume are moistened, torn into small
shreds, partially digested, and intimately commingled with earth;
and it is this process which gives to vegetable mould its uniform
dark tint.&nbsp; It is known that various kinds of acids are
generated by the decay of vegetable matter; and from the contents
of the intestines of worms and from their castings being acid, it
seems probable that the process of digestion induces an analogous
chemical change in the swallowed, triturated, and half-decayed
leaves.&nbsp; The large quantity of carbonate of lime secreted by
the calciferous glands apparently serves to neutralise the acids
thus generated; for the digestive fluid of worms will not act
unless it be alkaline.&nbsp; As the contents of the upper part of
their intestines are acid, the acidity can hardly be due to the
presence of uric acid.&nbsp; We may therefore conclude that the
acids in the alimentary canal of worms are formed during the
digestive process; and that probably they are nearly of the same
nature as those in ordinary mould or humus.&nbsp; The latter are
well known to have the power of de-oxidising or dissolving
per-oxide of iron, as may be seen wherever peat overlies red
sand, or where a rotten root penetrates such sand.&nbsp; Now I
kept some worms in a pot filled with very fine reddish sand,
consisting of minute particles of silex coated with the red oxide
of iron; and the burrows, which the worms made through this sand,
were lined or coated in the usual manner with their castings,
formed of the sand mingled with their intestinal secretions and
the refuse of the digested leaves; and this sand had almost
wholly lost its red colour.&nbsp; When small portions of it were
placed under the microscope, most of the grains were seen to be
transparent and colourless, owing to the dissolution of the
oxide; whilst almost all the grains taken from other parts of the
pot were coated with the oxide.&nbsp; Acetic acid produced hardly
any effect on his sand; and even hydrochloric, nitric and
sulphuric acids, diluted as in the Pharmacopoeia, produced less
effect than did the acids in the intestines of the worms.</p>
<p>Mr. A. A. Julien has lately collected all the extant
information about the acids generated in humus, which, according
to some chemists, amount to more than a dozen different
kinds.&nbsp; These acids, as well as their acid salts (i.e., in
combination with potash, soda, and ammonia), act energetically on
carbonate of lime and on the oxides of iron.&nbsp; It is also
known that some of these acids, which were called long ago by
Th&eacute;nard azohumic, are enabled to dissolve colloid silica
in proportion to the nitrogen which they contain. <a
name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220"
class="citation">[220]</a>&nbsp; In the formation of these latter
acids worms probably afford some aid, for Dr. H. Johnson informs
me that by Nessler&rsquo;s test he found 0.018 per cent. of
ammonia in their castings.</p>
<p>It may be here added that I have recently been informed by Dr.
Gilbert &ldquo;that several square yards on his lawn were swept
clean, and after two or three weeks all the worm-castings on the
space were collected and dried.&nbsp; These were found to contain
0.35 of nitrogen.&nbsp; This is from two to three times as much
as we find in our ordinary arable surface-soil; more than in our
ordinary pasture surface-soil; but less than in rich
kitchen-garden mould.&nbsp; Supposing a quantity of castings
equal to 10 tons in the dry state were annually deposited on an
acre, this would represent a manuring of 78 lbs. of nitrogen per
acre per annum; and this is very much more than the amount of
nitrogen in the annual yield of hay per acre, if raised without
any nitrogenous manure.&nbsp; Obviously, so far as the nitrogen
in the castings is derived from surface-growth or from
surface-soil, it is not a gain to the latter; but so far as it is
derived from below, it is a gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The several humus-acids, which appear, as we have just seen,
to be generated within the bodies of worms during the digestive
process, and their acid salts, play a highly important part,
according to the recent observations of Mr. Julien, in the
disintegration of various kinds of rocks.&nbsp; It has long been
known that the carbonic acid, and no doubt nitric and nitrous
acids, which are present in rain-water, act in like manner.&nbsp;
There is, also, a great excess of carbonic acid in all soils,
especially in rich soils, and this is dissolved by the water in
the ground.&nbsp; The living roots of plants, moreover, as Sachs
and others have shown, quickly corrode and leave their
impressions on polished slabs of marble, dolomite and phosphate
of lime.&nbsp; They will attack even basalt and sandstone. <a
name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a>&nbsp; But we are not here concerned
with agencies which are wholly independent of the action of
worms.</p>
<p>The combination of any acid with a base is much facilitated by
agitation, as fresh surfaces are thus continually brought into
contact.&nbsp; This will be thoroughly effected with the
particles of stone and earth in the intestines of worms, during
the digestive process; and it should be remembered that the
entire mass of the mould over every field, passes, in the course
of a few years, through their alimentary canals.&nbsp; Moreover
as the old burrows slowly collapse, and as fresh castings are
continually brought to the surface, the whole superficial layer
of mould slowly revolves or circulates; and the friction of the
particles one with another will rub off the finest films of
disintegrated matter as soon as they are formed.&nbsp; Through
these several means, minute fragments of rocks of many kinds and
mere particles in the soil will be continually exposed to
chemical decomposition; and thus the amount of soil will tend to
increase.</p>
<p>As worms line their burrows with their castings, and as the
burrows penetrate to a depth of 5 or 6, or even more feet, some
small amount of the humus-acids will be carried far down, and
will there act on the underlying rocks and fragments of
rock.&nbsp; Thus the thickness of the soil, if none be removed
from the surface, will steadily though slowly tend to increase;
but the accumulation will after a time delay the disintegration
of the underlying rocks and of the more deeply seated
particles.&nbsp; For the humus-acids which are generated chiefly
in the upper layer of vegetable mould, are extremely unstable
compounds, and are liable to decomposition before they reach any
considerable depth. <a name="citation223"></a><a
href="#footnote223" class="citation">[223]</a>&nbsp; A thick bed
of overlying soil will also check the downward extension of great
fluctuations of temperature, and in cold countries will check the
powerful action of frost.&nbsp; The free access of air will
likewise be excluded.&nbsp; From these several causes
disintegration would be almost arrested, if the overlying mould
were to increase much in thickness, owing to none or little being
removed from the surface. <a name="citation224a"></a><a
href="#footnote224a" class="citation">[224a]</a>&nbsp; In my own
immediate neighbourhood we have a curious proof how effectually a
few feet of clay checks some change which goes on in flints,
lying freely exposed; for the large ones which have lain for some
time on the surface of ploughed fields cannot be used for
building; they will not cleave properly, and are said by the
workmen to be rotten. <a name="citation224b"></a><a
href="#footnote224b" class="citation">[224b]</a>&nbsp; It is
therefore necessary to obtain flints for building purposes from
the bed of red clay overlying the chalk (the residue of its
dissolution by rain-water) or from the chalk itself.</p>
<p>Not only do worms aid directly in the chemical disintegration
of rocks, but there is good reason to believe that they likewise
act in a direct and mechanical manner on the smaller
particles.&nbsp; All the species which swallow earth are
furnished with gizzards; and these are lined with so thick a
chitinous membrane, that Perrier speaks of it, <a
name="citation225a"></a><a href="#footnote225a"
class="citation">[225a]</a> as &ldquo;une v&eacute;ritable
armature.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gizzard is surrounded by powerful
transverse muscles, which, according to Clapar&egrave;de, are
about ten times as thick as the longitudinal ones; and Perrier
saw them contracting energetically.&nbsp; Worms belonging to one
genus, Digaster, have two distinct but quite similar gizzards;
and in another genus, Moniligaster, the second gizzard consists
of four pouches, one succeeding the other, so that it may almost
be said to have five gizzards. <a name="citation225b"></a><a
href="#footnote225b" class="citation">[225b]</a>&nbsp; In the
same manner as gallinaceous and struthious birds swallow stones
to aid in the trituration of their food, so it appears to be with
terricolous worms.&nbsp; The gizzards of thirty-eight of our
common worms were opened, and in twenty-five of them small stones
or grains of sand, sometimes together with the hard calcareous
concretions formed within the anterior calciferous glands, were
found, and in two others concretions alone.&nbsp; In the gizzards
of the remaining worms there were no stones; but some of these
were not real exceptions, as the gizzards were opened late in the
autumn, when the worms had ceased to feed and their gizzards were
quite empty. <a name="citation226"></a><a href="#footnote226"
class="citation">[226]</a></p>
<p>When worms make their burrows through earth abounding with
little stones, no doubt many will be unavoidably swallowed; but
it must not be supposed that this fact accounts for the frequency
with which stones and sand are found in their gizzards.&nbsp; For
beads of glass and fragments of brick and of hard tiles were
scattered over the surface of the earth, in pots in which worms
were kept and had already made their burrows; and very many of
these beads and fragments were picked up and swallowed by the
worms, for they were found in their castings, intestines, and
gizzards.&nbsp; They even swallowed the coarse red dust, formed
by the pounding of the tiles.&nbsp; Nor can it be supposed that
they mistook the beads and fragments for food; for we have seen
that their taste is delicate enough to distinguish between
different kinds of leaves.&nbsp; It is therefore manifest that
they swallow hard objects, such as bits of stone, beads of glass
and angular fragments of bricks or tiles for some special
purpose; and it can hardly be doubted that this is to aid their
gizzards in crushing and grinding the earth, which they so
largely consume.&nbsp; That such hard objects are not necessary
for crushing leaves, may be inferred from the fact that certain
species, which live in mud or water and feed on dead or living
vegetable matter, but which do not swallow earth, are not
provided with gizzards, <a name="citation227"></a><a
href="#footnote227" class="citation">[227]</a> and therefore
cannot have the power of utilising stones.</p>
<p>During the grinding process, the particles of earth must be
rubbed against one another, and between the stones and the tough
lining membrane of the gizzard.&nbsp; The softer particles will
thus suffer some attrition, and will perhaps even be
crushed.&nbsp; This conclusion is supported by the appearance of
freshly ejected castings, for these often reminded me of the
appearance of paint which has just been ground by a workman
between two flat stones.&nbsp; Morren remarks that the intestinal
canal is &ldquo;impleta tenuissim&acirc; terr&acirc;, veluti in
pulverem redact&acirc;.&rdquo; <a name="citation228a"></a><a
href="#footnote228a" class="citation">[228a]</a>&nbsp; Perrier
also speaks of &ldquo;l&rsquo;&eacute;tat de p&acirc;te
excessivement fine &agrave; laquelle est r&eacute;duite la terre
qu&rsquo;ils rejettent,&rdquo; &amp;c. <a
name="citation228b"></a><a href="#footnote228b"
class="citation">[228b]</a></p>
<p>As the amount of trituration which the particles of earth
undergo in the gizzards of worms possesses some interest (as we
shall hereafter see), I endeavoured to obtain evidence on this
head by carefully examining many of the fragments which had
passed through their alimentary canals.&nbsp; With worms living
in a state of nature, it is of course impossible to know how much
the fragments may have been worn before they were
swallowed.&nbsp; It is, however, clear that worms do not
habitually select already rounded particles, for sharply angular
bits of flint and of other hard rocks were often found in their
gizzards or intestines.&nbsp; On three occasions sharp spines
from the stems of rose-bushes were thus found.&nbsp; Worms kept
in confinement repeatedly swallowed angular fragments of hard
tile, coal, cinders, and even the sharpest fragments of
glass.&nbsp; Gallinaceous and struthious birds retain the same
stones in their gizzards for a long time, which thus become well
rounded; but this does not appear to be the case with worms,
judging from the large number of the fragments of tiles, glass
beads, stones, &amp;c., commonly found in their castings and
intestines.&nbsp; So that unless the same fragments were to pass
repeatedly through their gizzards, visible signs of attrition in
the fragments could hardly be expected, except perhaps in the
case of very soft stones.</p>
<p>I will now give such evidence of attrition as I have been able
to collect.&nbsp; In the gizzards of some worms dug out of a thin
bed of mould over the chalk, there were many well-rounded small
fragments of chalk, and two fragments of the shells of a
land-mollusc (as ascertained by their microscopical structure),
which latter were not only rounded but somewhat polished.&nbsp;
The calcareous concretions formed in the calciferous glands,
which are often found in their gizzards, intestines, and
occasionally in their castings, when of large size, sometimes
appeared to have been rounded; but with all calcareous bodies the
rounded appearance may be partly or wholly due to their corrosion
by carbonic acid and the humus-acids.&nbsp; In the gizzards of
several worms collected in my kitchen garden near a hothouse,
eight little fragments of cinders were found, and of these, six
appeared more or less rounded, as were two bits of brick; but
some other bits were not at all rounded.&nbsp; A farm-road near
Abinger Hall had been covered seven years before with
brick-rubbish to the depth of about 6 inches; turf had grown over
this rubbish on both sides of the road for a width of 18 inches,
and on this turf there were innumerable castings.&nbsp; Some of
them were coloured of a uniform red owing to the presence of much
brick-dust, and they contained many particles of brick and of
hard mortar from 1 to 3 mm. in diameter, most of which were
plainly rounded; but all these particles may have been rounded
before they were protected by the turf and were swallowed, like
those on the bare parts of the road which were much worn.&nbsp; A
hole in a pasture-field had been filled up with brick-rubbish at
the same time, viz., seven years ago, and was now covered with
turf; and here the castings contained very many particles of
brick, all more or less rounded; and this brick-rubbish, after
being shot into the hole, could not have undergone any
attrition.&nbsp; Again, old bricks very little broken, together
with fragments of mortar, were laid down to form walks, and were
then covered with from 4 to 6 inches of gravel; six little
fragments of brick were extracted from castings collected on
these walks, three of which were plainly worn.&nbsp; There were
also very many particles of hard mortar, about half of which were
well rounded; and it is not credible that these could have
suffered so much corrosion from the action of carbonic acid in
the course of only seven years.</p>
<p>Much better evidence of the attrition of hard objects in the
gizzards of worms, is afforded by the state of the small
fragments of tiles or bricks, and of concrete in the castings
thrown up where ancient buildings once stood.&nbsp; As all the
mould covering a field passes every few years through the bodies
of worms, the same small fragments will probably be swallowed and
brought to the surface many times in the course of
centuries.&nbsp; It should be premised that in the several
following cases, the finer matter was first washed away from the
castings, and then <i>all</i> the particles of bricks, tiles and
concrete were collected without any selection, and were
afterwards examined.&nbsp; Now in the castings ejected between
the tesser&aelig; on one of the buried floors of the Roman villa
at Abinger, there were many particles (from &frac12; to 2 mm. in
diameter) of tiles and concrete, which it was impossible to look
at with the naked eye or through a strong lens, and doubt for a
moment that they had almost all undergone much attrition.&nbsp; I
speak thus after having examined small water-worn pebbles, formed
from Roman bricks, which M. Henri de Saussure had the kindness to
send me, and which he had extracted from sand and gravel beds,
deposited on the shores of the Lake of Geneva, at a former period
when the water stood at about two metres above its present
level.&nbsp; The smallest of these water-worn pebbles of brick
from Geneva resembled closely many of those extracted from the
gizzards of worms, but the larger ones were somewhat
smoother.</p>
<p>Four castings found on the recently uncovered, tesselated
floor of the great room in the Roman villa at Brading, contained
many particles of tile or brick, of mortar, and of hard white
cement; and the majority of these appeared plainly worn.&nbsp;
The particles of mortar, however, seemed to have suffered more
corrosion than attrition, for grains of silex often projected
from their surfaces.&nbsp; Castings from within the nave of
Beaulieu Abbey, which was destroyed by Henry VIII., were
collected from a level expanse of turf, overlying the buried
tesselated pavement, through which worm-burrows passed; and these
castings contained innumerable particles of tiles and bricks, of
concrete and cement, the majority of which had manifestly
undergone some or much attrition.&nbsp; There were also many
minute flakes of a micaceous slate, the points of which were
rounded.&nbsp; If the above supposition, that in all these cases
the same minute fragments have passed several times through the
gizzards of worms, be rejected, notwithstanding its inherent
probability, we must then assume that in all the above cases the
many rounded fragments found in the castings had all accidentally
undergone much attrition before they were swallowed; and this is
highly improbable.</p>
<p>On the other hand it must be stated that fragments of
ornamental tiles, somewhat harder than common tiles or bricks,
which had been swallowed only once by worms kept in confinement,
were with the doubtful exception of one or two of the smallest
grains, not at all rounded.&nbsp; Nevertheless some of them
appeared a little worn, though not rounded.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
these cases, if we consider the evidence above given, there can
be little doubt that the fragments, which serve as millstones in
the gizzards of worms, suffer, when of a not very hard texture,
some amount of attrition; and that the smaller particles in the
earth, which is habitually swallowed in such astonishingly large
quantities by worms, are ground together and are thus
levigated.&nbsp; If this be the case, the &ldquo;terra
tenuissima,&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;p&acirc;te excessivement
fine,&rdquo;&mdash;of which the castings largely consist, is in
part due to the mechanical action of the gizzard; <a
name="citation234"></a><a href="#footnote234"
class="citation">[234]</a> and this fine matter, as we shall see
in the next chapter, is that which is chiefly washed away from
the innumerable castings on every field during each heavy shower
of rain.&nbsp; If the softer stones yield at all, the harder ones
will suffer some slight amount of wear and tear.</p>
<p>The trituration of small particles of stone in the gizzards of
worms is of more importance under a geological point of view than
may at first appear to be the case; for Mr. Sorby has clearly
shown that the ordinary means of disintegration, namely, running
water and the waves of the sea, act with less and less power on
fragments of rock the smaller they are.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; as he remarks, &ldquo;even making no
allowance for the extra buoying up of very minute particles by a
current of water, depending on surface cohesion, the effects of
wearing on the form of the grains must vary directly as their
diameter or thereabouts.&nbsp; If so, a grain of 1/10 an inch in
diameter would be worn ten times as much as one of an inch in
diameter, and at least a hundred times as much as one of 1/100 an
inch in diameter.&nbsp; Perhaps, then, we may conclude that a
grain 1/10 of an inch in diameter would be worn as much or more
in drifting a mile as a grain 1/1000 of an inch in being drifted
100 miles.&nbsp; On the same principle a pebble one inch in
diameter would be worn relatively more by being drifted only a
few hundred yards.&rdquo; <a name="citation236"></a><a
href="#footnote236" class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; Nor should
we forget, in considering the power which worms exert in
triturating particles of rock, that there is good evidence that
on each acre of land, which is sufficiently damp and not too
sandy, gravelly or rocky for worms to inhabit, a weight of more
than ten tons of earth annually passes through their bodies and
is brought to the surface.&nbsp; The result for a country of the
size of Great Britain, within a period not very long in a
geological sense, such as a million years, cannot be
insignificant; for the ten tons of earth has to be multiplied
first by the above number of years, and then by the number of
acres fully stocked with worms; and in England, together with
Scotland, the land which is cultivated and is well fitted for
these animals, has been estimated at above 32 million
acres.&nbsp; The product is 320 million million tons of
earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are now prepared to consider the
more direct part which worms take in the denudation of the
land.&nbsp; When reflecting on sub-aerial denudation, it formerly
appeared to me, as it has to others, that a nearly level or very
gently inclined surface, covered with turf, could suffer no loss
during even a long lapse of time.&nbsp; It may, however, be urged
that at long intervals, debacles of rain or water-spouts would
remove all the mould from a very gentle slope; but when examining
the steep, turf-covered slopes in Glen Roy, I was struck with the
fact how rarely any such event could have happened since the
Glacial period, as was plain from the well-preserved state of the
three successive &ldquo;roads&rdquo; or lake-margins.&nbsp; But
the difficulty in believing that earth in any appreciable
quantity can be removed from a gently inclined surface, covered
with vegetation and matted with roots, is removed through the
agency of worms.&nbsp; For the many castings which are thrown up
during rain, and those thrown up some little time before heavy
rain, flow for a short distance down an inclined surface.&nbsp;
Moreover much of the finest levigated earth is washed completely
away from the castings.&nbsp; During dry weather castings often
disintegrate into small rounded pellets, and these from their
weight often roll down any slope.&nbsp; This is more especially
apt to occur when they are started by the wind, and probably when
started by the touch of an animal, however small.&nbsp; We shall
also see that a strong wind blows all the castings, even on a
level field, to leeward, whilst they are soft; and in like manner
the pellets when they are dry.&nbsp; If the wind blows in nearly
the direction of an inclined surface, the flowing down of the
castings is much aided.</p>
<p>The observations on which these several statements are founded
must now be given in some detail.&nbsp; Castings when first
ejected are viscid and soft; during rain, at which time worms
apparently prefer to eject them, they are still softer; so that I
have sometimes thought that worms must swallow much water at such
times.&nbsp; However this may be, rain, even when not very heavy,
if long continued, renders recently-ejected castings semi-fluid;
and on level ground they then spread out into thin, circular,
flat discs, exactly as would so much honey or very soft mortar,
with all traces of their vermiform structure lost.&nbsp; This
latter fact was sometimes made evident, when a worm had
subsequently bored through a flat circular disc of this kind, and
heaped up a fresh vermiform mass in the centre.&nbsp; These flat
subsided discs have been repeatedly seen by me after heavy rain,
in many places on land of all kinds.</p>
<p><i>On the flowing of wet castings</i>, <i>and the rolling of
dry disintegrated castings down inclined surfaces</i>.&mdash;When
castings are ejected on an inclined surface during or shortly
before heavy rain, they cannot fail to flow a little down the
slope.&nbsp; Thus, on some steep slopes in Knole Park, which were
covered with coarse grass and had apparently existed in this
state from time immemorial, I found (Oct. 22, 1872) after several
wet days that almost all the many castings were considerably
elongated in the line of the slope; and that they now consisted
of smooth, only slightly conical masses.&nbsp; Whenever the
mouths of the burrows could be found from which the earth had
been ejected, there was more earth below than above them.&nbsp;
After some heavy storms of rain (Jan. 25, 1872) two rather
steeply inclined fields near Down, which had formerly been
ploughed and were now rather sparsely clothed with poor grass,
were visited, and many castings extended down the slopes for a
length of 5 inches, which was twice or thrice the usual diameter
of the castings thrown up on the level parts of these same
fields.&nbsp; On some fine grassy slopes in Holwood Park,
inclined at angles between 8&deg; and 11&deg; 30&prime; with the
horizon, where the surface apparently had never been disturbed by
the hand of man, castings abounded in extraordinary numbers: and
a space 16 inches in length transversely to the slope and 6
inches in the line of the slope, was completely coated, between
the blades of grass, with a uniform sheet of confluent and
subsided castings.&nbsp; Here also in many places the castings
had flowed down the slope, and now formed smooth narrow patches
of earth, 6, 7, and 7&frac12; inches in length.&nbsp; Some of
these consisted of two castings, one above the other, which had
become so completely confluent that they could hardly be
distinguished.&nbsp; On my lawn, clothed with very fine grass,
most of the castings are black, but some are yellowish from earth
having been brought up from a greater depth than usual, and the
flowing-down of these yellow castings after heavy rain, could be
clearly seen where the slope was 5&deg;; and where it was less
than 1&deg; some evidence of their flowing down could still be
detected.&nbsp; On another occasion, after rain which was never
heavy, but which lasted for 18 hours, all the castings on this
same gently inclined lawn had lost their vermiform structure; and
they had flowed, so that fully two-thirds of the ejected earth
lay below the mouths of the burrows.</p>
<p>These observations led me to make others with more care.&nbsp;
Eight castings were found on my lawn, where the grass-blades are
fine and close together, and three others on a field with coarse
grass.&nbsp; The inclination of the surface at the eleven places
where these castings were collected varied between 4&deg;
30&prime; and 17&deg; 30&prime;; the mean of the eleven
inclinations being 9&deg; 26&prime;.&nbsp; The length of the
castings in the direction of the slope was first measured with as
much accuracy as their irregularities would permit.&nbsp; It was
found possible to make these measurements within about of an
inch, but one of the castings was too irregular to admit of
measurement.&nbsp; The average length in the direction of the
slope of the remaining ten castings was 2.03 inches.&nbsp; The
castings were then divided with a knife into two parts along a
horizontal line passing through the mouth of the burrow, which
was discovered by slicing off the turf; and all the ejected earth
was separately collected, namely, the part above the hole and the
part below.&nbsp; Afterwards these two parts were weighed.&nbsp;
In every case there was much more earth below than above; the
mean weight of that above being 103 grains, and of that below 205
grains; so that the latter was very nearly double the
former.&nbsp; As on level ground castings are commonly thrown up
almost equally round the mouths of the burrows, this difference
in weight indicates the amount of ejected earth which had flowed
down the slope.&nbsp; But very many more observations would be
requisite to arrive at any general result; for the nature of the
vegetation and other accidental circumstances, such as the
heaviness of the rain, the direction and force of the wind,
&amp;c., appear to be more important in determining the quantity
of the earth which flows down a slope than its angle.&nbsp; Thus
with four castings on my lawn (included in the above eleven)
where the mean slope was 7&deg; 19&prime;, the difference in the
amount of earth above and below the burrows was greater than with
three other castings on the same lawn where the mean slope was
12&deg; 5&prime;.</p>
<p>We may, however, take the above eleven cases, which are
accurate as far as they go, and calculate the weight of the
ejected earth which annually flows down a slope having a mean
inclination of 9&deg; 26&prime;.&nbsp; This was done by my son
George.&nbsp; It has been shown that almost exactly two-thirds of
the ejected earth is found below the mouth of the burrow and
one-third above it.&nbsp; Now if the two-thirds which is below
the hole be divided into two equal parts, the upper half of this
two-thirds exactly counterbalances the one-third which is above
the hole, so that as far as regards the one-third above and the
upper half of the two-thirds below, there is no flow of earth
down the hill-side.&nbsp; The earth constituting the lower half
of the two-thirds is, however, displaced through distances which
are different for every part of it, but which may be represented
by the distance between the middle point of the lower half of the
two-thirds and the hole.&nbsp; So that the average distance of
displacement is a half of the whole length of the
worm-casting.&nbsp; Now the average length of ten out of the
above eleven castings was 2.03 inches, and half of this we may
take as being 1 inch.&nbsp; It may therefore be concluded that
one-third of the whole earth brought to the surface was in these
cases carried down the slope through 1 inch. <a
name="citation244"></a><a href="#footnote244"
class="citation">[244]</a></p>
<p>It was shown in the third chapter that on Leith Hill Common,
dry earth weighing at least 7.453 lbs. was brought up by worms to
the surface on a square yard in the course of a year.&nbsp; If a
square yard be drawn on a hillside with two of its sides
horizontal, then it is clear that only 1/36 part of the earth
brought up on that square yard would be near enough to its lower
side to cross it, supposing the displacement of the earth to be
through one inch.&nbsp; But it appears that only &#8531; of the
earth brought up can be considered to flow downwards; hence
&#8531; of 1/36 or 1/108 of 7.453 lbs. will cross the lower side
of our square yard in a year.&nbsp; Now 1/108 of 7.453 lbs. is
1.1 oz.&nbsp; Therefore 1.1 oz. of dry earth will annually cross
each linear yard running horizontally along a slope having the
above inclination; or very nearly 7 lbs. will annually cross a
horizontal line, 100 yards in length, on a hill-side having this
inclination.</p>
<p>A more accurate, though still very rough, calculation can be
made of the bulk of earth, which in its natural damp state
annually flows down the same slope over a yard-line drawn
horizontally across it.&nbsp; From the several cases given in the
third chapter, it is known that the castings annually brought to
the surface on a square yard, if uniformly spread out would form
a layer 0.2 of an inch in thickness: it therefore follows by a
calculation similar to the one already given, that &#8531; of 0.2
&times; 36, or 2.4 cubic inches of damp earth will annually cross
a horizontal line one yard in length on a hillside with the above
inclination.&nbsp; This bulk of damp castings was found to weigh
1.85 oz.&nbsp; Therefore 11.56 lbs. of damp earth, instead of 7
lbs. of dry earth as by the former calculation, would annually
cross a line 100 yards in length on our inclined surface.</p>
<p>In these calculations it has been assumed that the castings
flow a short distance downwards during the whole year, but this
occurs only with those ejected during or shortly before rain; so
that the above results are thus far exaggerated.&nbsp; On the
other hand, during rain much of the finest earth is washed to a
considerable distance from the castings, even where the slope is
an extremely gentle one, and is thus wholly lost as far as the
above calculations are concerned.&nbsp; Castings ejected during
dry weather and which have set hard, lose in the same manner a
considerable quantity of fine earth.&nbsp; Dried castings,
moreover, are apt to disintegrate into little pellets, which
often roll or are blown down any inclined surface.&nbsp;
Therefore the above result, namely, that 24 cubic inches of earth
(weighing 1.85 oz. whilst damp) annually crosses a yard-line of
the specified kind, is probably not much if at all
exaggerated.</p>
<p>This amount is small; but we should bear in mind how many
branching valleys intersect most countries, the whole length of
which must be very great; and that earth is steadily travelling
down both turf-covered sides of each valley.&nbsp; For every 100
yards in length in a valley with sides sloping as in the
foregoing cases, 480 cubic inches of damp earth, weighing above
23 pounds, will annually reach the bottom.&nbsp; Here a thick bed
of alluvium will accumulate, ready to be washed away in the
course of centuries, as the stream in the middle meanders from
side to side.</p>
<p>If it could be shown that worms generally excavate their
burrows at right angles to an inclined surface, and this would be
their shortest course for bringing up earth from beneath, then as
the old burrows collapsed from the weight of the superincumbent
soil, the collapsing would inevitably cause the whole bed of
vegetable mould to sink or slide slowly down the inclined
surface.&nbsp; But to ascertain the direction of many burrows was
found too difficult and troublesome.&nbsp; A straight piece of
wire was, however, pushed into twenty-five burrows on several
sloping fields, and in eight cases the burrows were nearly at
right angles to the slope; whilst in the remaining cases they
were indifferently directed at various angles, either upwards or
downwards with respect to the slope.</p>
<p>In countries where the rain is very heavy, as in the tropics,
the castings appear, as might have been expected, to be washed
down in a greater degree than in England.&nbsp; Mr. Scott informs
me that near Calcutta the tall columnar castings (previously
described), the diameter of which is usually between 1 and
1&frac12; inch, subside on a level surface, after heavy rain,
into almost circular, thin, flat discs, between 3 and 4 and
sometimes 5 inches in diameter.&nbsp; Three fresh castings, which
had been ejected in the Botanic Gardens &ldquo;on a slightly
inclined, grass-covered, artificial bank of loamy clay,&rdquo;
were carefully measured, and had a mean height of 2.17, and a
mean diameter of 1.43 inches; these after heavy rain, formed
elongated patches of earth, with a mean length in the direction
of the slope of 5.83 inches.&nbsp; As the earth had spread very
little up the slope, a large part, judging from the original
diameter of these castings, must have flowed bodily downwards
about 4 inches.&nbsp; Moreover some of the finest earth of which
they were composed must have been washed completely away to a
still greater distance.&nbsp; In drier sites near Calcutta, a
species of worm ejects its castings, not in vermiform masses, but
in little pellets of varying sizes: these are very numerous in
some places, and Mr. Scott says that they &ldquo;are washed away
by every shower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was led to believe that a considerable quantity of fine
earth is washed quite away from castings during rain, from the
surfaces of old ones being often studded with coarse
particles.&nbsp; Accordingly a little fine precipitated chalk,
moistened with saliva or gum-water, so as to be slightly viscid
and of the same consistence as a fresh casting, was placed on the
summits of several castings and gently mixed with them.&nbsp;
These castings were then watered through a very fine rose, the
drops from which were closer together than those of rain, but not
nearly so large as those in a thunderstorm; nor did they strike
the ground with nearly so much force as drops during heavy
rain.&nbsp; A casting thus treated subsided with surprising
slowness, owing as I suppose to its viscidity.&nbsp; It did not
flow bodily down the grass-covered surface of the lawn, which was
here inclined at an angle of 16&deg; 20&prime;; nevertheless many
particles of the chalk were found three inches below the
casting.&nbsp; The experiment was repeated on three other
castings on different parts of the lawn, which sloped at 2&deg;
30&prime;, 3&deg; and 6&deg;; and particles of chalk could be
seen between 4 and 5 inches below the casting; and after the
surface had become dry, particles were found in two cases at a
distance of 5 and 6 inches.&nbsp; Several other castings with
precipitated chalk placed on their summits were left to the
natural action of the rain.&nbsp; In one case, after rain which
was not heavy, the casting was longitudinally streaked with
white.&nbsp; In two other cases the surface of the ground was
rendered somewhat white for a distance of one inch from the
casting; and some soil collected at a distance of 2&frac12;
inches, where the slope was 7&deg;, effervesced slightly when
placed in acid.&nbsp; After one or two weeks, the chalk was
wholly or almost wholly washed away from all the castings on
which it had been placed, and these had recovered their natural
colour.</p>
<p>It may be here remarked that after very heavy rain shallow
pools may be seen on level or nearly level fields, where the soil
is not very porous, and the water in them is often slightly
muddy; when such little pools have dried, the leaves and blades
of grass at their bottoms are generally coated with a thin layer
of mud.&nbsp; This mud I believe is derived in large part from
recently ejected castings.</p>
<p>Dr. King informs me that the majority of the before described
gigantic castings, which he found on a fully exposed, bare,
gravelly knoll on the Nilgiri Mountains in India, had been more
or less weathered by the previous north-east monsoon; and most of
them presented a subsided appearance.&nbsp; The worms here eject
their castings only during the rainy season; and at the time of
Dr. King&rsquo;s visit no rain had fallen for 110 days.&nbsp; He
carefully examined the ground between the place where these huge
castings lay, and a little watercourse at the base of the knoll,
and nowhere was there any accumulation of fine earth, such as
would necessarily have been left by the disintegration of the
castings if they had not been wholly removed.&nbsp; He therefore
has no hesitation in asserting that the whole of these huge
castings are annually washed during the two monsoons (when about
100 inches of rain fall) into the little water-course, and thence
into the plains lying below at a depth of 3000 or 4000 feet.</p>
<p>Castings ejected before or during dry weather become hard,
sometimes surprisingly hard, from the particles of earth having
been cemented together by the intestinal secretions.&nbsp; Frost
seems to be less effective in their disintegration than might
have been expected.&nbsp; Nevertheless they readily disintegrate
into small pellets, after being alternately moistened with rain
and again dried.&nbsp; Those which have flowed during rain down a
slope, disintegrate in the same manner.&nbsp; Such pellets often
roll a little down any sloping surface; their descent being
sometimes much aided by the wind.&nbsp; The whole bottom of a
broad dry ditch in my grounds, where there were very few fresh
castings, was completely covered with these pellets or
disintegrated castings, which had rolled down the steep sides,
inclined at an angle of 27&deg;.</p>
<p>Near Nice, in places where the great cylindrical castings,
previously described, abound, the soil consists of very fine
arenaceo-calcareous loam; and Dr. King informs me that these
castings are extremely liable to crumble during dry weather into
small fragments, which are soon acted on by rain, and then sink
down so as to be no longer distinguishable from the surrounding
soil.&nbsp; He sent me a mass of such disintegrated castings,
collected on the top of a bank, where none could have rolled down
from above.&nbsp; They must have been ejected within the previous
five or six months, but they now consisted of more or less
rounded fragments of all sizes, from &frac34; of an inch in
diameter to minute grains and mere dust.&nbsp; Dr. King witnessed
the crumbling process whilst drying some perfect castings, which
he afterwards sent me.&nbsp; Mr. Scott also remarks on the
crumbling of the castings near Calcutta and on the mountains of
Sikkim during the hot and dry season.</p>
<p>When the castings near Nice had been ejected on an inclined
surface, the disintegrated fragments rolled downwards, without
losing their distinctive shape; and in some places could
&ldquo;be collected in basketfuls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. King observed
a striking instance of this fact on the Corniche road, where a
drain, about 2&frac12; feet wide and 9 inches deep, had been made
to catch the surface drainage from the adjoining hill-side.&nbsp;
The bottom of this drain was covered for a distance of several
hundred yards, to a depth of from 1&frac12; to 3 inches, by a
layer of broken castings, still retaining their characteristic
shape.&nbsp; Nearly all these innumerable fragments had rolled
down from above, for extremely few castings had been ejected in
the drain itself.&nbsp; The hill-side was steep, but varied much
in inclination, which Dr. King estimated at from 30&deg; to
60&deg; with the horizon.&nbsp; He climbed up the slope, and
&ldquo;found every here and there little embankments, formed by
fragments of the castings that had been arrested in their
downward progress by irregularities of the surface, by stones,
twigs, &amp;c.&nbsp; One little group of plants of <i>Anemone
hortensis</i> had acted in this manner, and quite a small bank of
soil had collected round it.&nbsp; Much of this soil had crumbled
down, but a great deal of it still retained the form of
castings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. King dug up this plant, and was struck
with the thickness of the soil which must have recently
accumulated over the crown of the rhizoma, as shown by the length
of the bleached petioles, in comparison with those of other
plants of the same kind, where there had been no such
accumulation.&nbsp; The earth thus accumulated had no doubt been
secured (as I have everywhere seen) by the smaller roots of the
plants.&nbsp; After describing this and other analogous cases,
Dr. King concludes: &ldquo;I can have no doubt that worms help
greatly in the process of denudation.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Ledges of earth on steep hill-sides</i>.&mdash;Little
horizontal ledges, one above another, have been observed on steep
grassy slopes in many parts of the world.&nbsp; The formation has
been attributed to animals travelling repeatedly along the slope
in the same horizontal lines while grazing, and that they do thus
move and use the ledges is certain; but Professor Henslow (a most
careful observer) told Sir J. Hooker that he was convinced that
this was not the sole cause of their formation.&nbsp; Sir J.
Hooker saw such ledges on the Himalayan and Atlas ranges, where
there were no domesticated animals and not many wild ones; but
these latter would, it is probable, use the ledges at night while
grazing like our domesticated animals.&nbsp; A friend observed
for me the ledges on the Alps of Switzerland, and states that
they ran at 3 or 4 ft. one above the other, and were about a foot
in breadth.&nbsp; They had been deeply pitted by the feet of
grazing cows.&nbsp; Similar ledges were observed by the same
friend on our Chalk downs, and on an old talus of chalk-fragments
(thrown out of a quarry) which had become clothed with turf.</p>
<p>My son Francis examined a Chalk escarpment near Lewes; and
here on a part which was very steep, sloping at 40&deg; with the
horizon, about 30 flat ledges extended horizontally for more than
100 yards, at an average distance of about 20 inches, one beneath
the other.&nbsp; They were from 9 to 10 inches in breadth.&nbsp;
When viewed from a distance they presented a striking appearance,
owing to their parallelism; but when examined closely, they were
seen to be somewhat sinuous, and one often ran into another,
giving the appearance of the ledge having forked into two.&nbsp;
They are formed of light-coloured earth, which on the outside,
where thickest, was in one case 9 inches, and in another case
between 6 and 7 inches in thickness.&nbsp; Above the ledges, the
thickness of the earth over the chalk was in the former case 4
and in the latter only 3 inches.&nbsp; The grass grew more
vigorously on the outer edges of the ledges than on any other
part of the slope, and here formed a tufted fringe.&nbsp; Their
middle part was bare, but whether this had been caused by the
trampling of sheep, which sometimes frequent the ledges, my son
could not ascertain.&nbsp; Nor could he feel sure how much of the
earth on the middle and bare parts, consisted of disintegrated
worm-castings which had rolled down from above; but he felt
convinced that some had thus originated; and it was manifest that
the ledges with their grass-fringed edges would arrest any small
object rolling down from above.</p>
<p>At one end or side of the bank bearing these ledges, the
surface consisted in parts of bare chalk, and here the ledges
were very irregular.&nbsp; At the other end of the bank, the
slope suddenly became less steep, and here the ledges ceased
rather abruptly; but little embankments only a foot or two in
length were still present.&nbsp; The slope became steeper lower
down the hill, and the regular ledges then reappeared.&nbsp;
Another of my sons observed, on the inland side of Beachy Head,
where the surface sloped at about 25&deg;, many short little
embankments like those just mentioned.&nbsp; They extended
horizontally and were from a few inches to two or three feet in
length.&nbsp; They supported tufts of grass growing
vigorously.&nbsp; The average thickness of the mould of which
they were formed, taken from nine measurements, was 4.5 inches;
while that of the mould above and beneath them was on an average
only 3.2 inches, and on each side, on the same level, 3.1
inches.&nbsp; On the upper parts of the slope, these embankments
showed no signs of having been trampled on by sheep, but in the
lower parts such signs were fairly plain.&nbsp; No long
continuous ledges had here been formed.</p>
<p>If the little embankments above the Corniche road, which Dr.
King saw in the act of formation by the accumulation of
disintegrated and rolled worm-castings, were to become confluent
along horizontal lines, ledges would be formed.&nbsp; Each
embankment would tend to extend laterally by the lateral
extension of the arrested castings; and animals grazing on a
steep slope would almost certainly make use of every prominence
at nearly the same level, and would indent the turf between them;
and such intermediate indentations would again arrest the
castings.&nbsp; An irregular ledge when once formed would also
tend to become more regular and horizontal by some of the
castings rolling laterally from the higher to the lower parts,
which would thus be raised.&nbsp; Any projection beneath a ledge
would not afterwards receive disintegrated matter from above, and
would tend to be obliterated by rain and other atmospheric
agencies.&nbsp; There is some analogy between the formation, as
here supposed, of these ledges, and that of the ripples of
wind-drifted sand as described by Lyell. <a
name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259"
class="citation">[259]</a></p>
<p>The steep, grass-covered sides of a mountainous valley in
Westmoreland, called Grisedale, was marked in many places with
innumerable lines of miniature cliffs, with almost horizontal,
little ledges at their bases.&nbsp; Their formation was in no way
connected with the action of worms, for castings could not
anywhere be seen (and their absence is an inexplicable fact),
although the turf lay in many places over a considerable
thickness of boulder-clay and moraine rubbish.&nbsp; Nor, as far
as I could judge, was the formation of these little cliffs at all
closely connected with the trampling of cows or sheep.&nbsp; It
appeared as if the whole superficial, somewhat argillaceous
earth, while partially held together by the roots of the grasses,
had slided a little way down the mountain sides; and in thus
sliding, had yielded and cracked in horizontal lines,
transversely to the slope.</p>
<p><i>Castings blown to leeward by the wind</i>.&mdash;We have
seen that moist castings flow, and that disintegrated castings
roll down any inclined surface; and we shall now see that
castings, recently ejected on level grass-covered surfaces, are
blown during gales of wind accompanied by rain to leeward.&nbsp;
This has been observed by me many times on many fields during
several successive years.&nbsp; After such gales, the castings
present a gently inclined and smooth, or sometimes furrowed,
surface to windward, while they are steeply inclined or
precipitous to leeward, so that they resemble on a miniature
scale glacier-ground hillocks of rock.&nbsp; They are often
cavernous on the leeward side, from the upper part having curled
over the lower part.&nbsp; During one unusually heavy south-west
gale with torrents of rain, many castings were wholly blown to
leeward, so that the mouths of the burrows were left naked and
exposed on the windward side.&nbsp; Recent castings naturally
flow down an inclined surface, but on a grassy field, which
sloped between 10&deg; and 15&deg;, several were found after a
heavy gale blown up the slope.&nbsp; This likewise occurred on
another occasion on a part of my lawn where the slope was
somewhat less.&nbsp; On a third occasion, the castings on the
steep, grass-covered sides of a valley, down which a gale had
blown, were directed obliquely instead of straight down the
slope; and this was obviously due to the combined action of the
wind and gravity.&nbsp; Four castings on my lawn, where the
downward inclination was 0&deg; 45&prime;, 1&deg;, 3&deg; and
3&deg; 30&prime; (mean 2&deg; 45&prime;) towards the north-east,
after a heavy south-west gale with rain, were divided across the
mouths of the burrows and weighed in the manner formerly
described.&nbsp; The mean weight of the earth below the mouths of
burrows and to leeward, was to that above the mouths and on the
windward side as 2&frac34; to 1; whereas we have seen that with
several castings which had flowed down slopes having a mean
inclination of 9&deg; 26&prime;, and with three castings where
the inclination was above 12&deg;; the proportional weight of the
earth below to that above the burrows was as only 2 to 1.&nbsp;
These several cases show how efficiently gales of wind
accompanied by rain act in displacing recently ejected
castings.&nbsp; We may therefore conclude that even a moderately
strong wind will produce some slight effect on them.</p>
<p>Dry and indurated castings, after their disintegration into
small fragments or pellets, are sometimes, probably often, blown
by a strong wind to leeward.&nbsp; This was observed on four
occasions, but I did not sufficiently attend to this point.&nbsp;
One old casting on a gently sloping bank was blown quite away by
a strong south-west wind.&nbsp; Dr. King believes that the wind
removes the greater part of the old crumbling castings near
Nice.&nbsp; Several old castings on my lawn were marked with pins
and protected from any disturbance.&nbsp; They were examined
after an interval of 10 weeks, during which time the weather had
been alternately dry and rainy.&nbsp; Some, which were of a
yellowish colour had been washed almost completely away, as could
be seen by the colour of the surrounding ground.&nbsp; Others had
completely disappeared, and these no doubt had been blown
away.&nbsp; Lastly, others still remained and would long remain,
as blades of grass had grown through them.&nbsp; On poor
pasture-land, which has never been rolled and has not been much
trampled on by animals, the whole surface is sometimes dotted
with little pimples, through and on which grass grows; and these
pimples consist of old worm-castings.</p>
<p>In all the many observed cases of soft castings blown to
leeward, this had been effected by strong winds accompanied by
rain.&nbsp; As such winds in England generally blow from the
south and south-west, earth must on the whole tend to travel over
our fields in a north and north-east direction.&nbsp; This fact
is interesting, because it might be thought that none could be
removed from a level, grass-covered surface by any means.&nbsp;
In thick and level woods, protected from the wind, castings will
never be removed as long as the wood lasts; and mould will here
tend to accumulate to the depth at which worms can work.&nbsp; I
tried to procure evidence as to how much mould is blown, whilst
in the state of castings, by our wet southern gales to the
north-east, over open and flat land, by looking to the level of
the surface on opposite sides of old trees and hedge-rows; but I
failed owing to the unequal growth of the roots of trees and to
most pasture-land having been formerly ploughed.</p>
<p>On an open plain near Stonehenge, there exist shallow circular
trenches, with a low embankment outside, surrounding level spaces
50 yards in diameter.&nbsp; These rings appear very ancient, and
are believed to be contemporaneous with the Druidical
stones.&nbsp; Castings ejected within these circular spaces, if
blown to the north-east by south-west winds would form a layer of
mould within the trench, thicker on the north-eastern than on any
other side.&nbsp; But the site was not favourable for the action
of worms, for the mould over the surrounding Chalk formation with
flints, was only 3.37 inches in thickness, from a mean of six
observations made at a distance of 10 yards outside the
embankment.&nbsp; The thickness of the mould within two of the
circular trenches was measured every 5 yards all round, on the
inner sides near the bottom.&nbsp; My son Horace protracted these
measurements on paper; and though the curved line representing
the thickness of the mould was extremely irregular, yet in both
diagrams it could be seen to be thicker on the north-eastern side
than elsewhere.&nbsp; When a mean of all the measurements in both
the trenches was laid down and the line smoothed, it was obvious
that the mould was thickest in the quarter of the circle between
north-west and north-east; and thinnest in the quarter between
south-east and south-west, especially at this latter point.&nbsp;
Besides the foregoing measurements, six others were taken near
together in one of the circular trenches, on the north-east side;
and the mould here had a mean thickness of 2.29 inches; while the
mean of six other measurements on the south-west side was only
1.46 inches.&nbsp; These observations indicate that the castings
had been blown by the south-west winds from the circular enclosed
space into the trench on the north-east side; but many more
measurements in other analogous cases would be requisite for a
trustworthy result.</p>
<p>The amount of fine earth brought to the surface under the form
of castings, and afterwards transported by the winds accompanied
by rain, or that which flows and rolls down an inclined surface,
no doubt is small in the course of a few scores of years; for
otherwise all the inequalities in our pasture fields would be
smoothed within a much shorter period than appears to be the
case.&nbsp; But the amount which is thus transported in the
course of thousands of years cannot fail to be considerable and
deserves attention.&nbsp; &Eacute;. de Beaumont looks at the
vegetable mould which everywhere covers the land as a fixed line,
from which the amount of denudation may be measured. <a
name="citation265"></a><a href="#footnote265"
class="citation">[265]</a>&nbsp; He ignores the continued
formation of fresh mould by the disintegration of the underlying
rocks and fragments of rock; and it is curious to find how much
more philosophical were the views maintained long ago, by
Playfair, who, in 1802, wrote, &ldquo;In the permanence of a coat
of vegetable mould on the surface of the earth, we have a
demonstrative proof of the continued destruction of the
rocks.&rdquo; <a name="citation266"></a><a href="#footnote266"
class="citation">[266]</a></p>
<p><i>Ancient encampments and tumuli</i>.&mdash;&Eacute;. de
Beaumont adduces the present state of many ancient encampments
and tumuli and of old ploughed fields, as evidence that the
surface of the land undergoes hardly any degradation.&nbsp; But
it does not appear that he ever examined the thickness of the
mould over different parts of such old remains.&nbsp; He relies
chiefly on indirect, but apparently trustworthy, evidence that
the slopes of the old embankments are the same as they originally
were; and it is obvious that he could know nothing about their
original heights.&nbsp; In Knole Park a mound had been thrown up
behind the rifle-targets, which appeared to have been formed of
earth originally supported by square blocks of turf.&nbsp; The
sides sloped, as nearly as I could estimate them, at an angle of
45&deg; or 50&deg; with the horizon, and they were covered,
especially on the northern side, with long coarse grass, beneath
which many worm-castings were found.&nbsp; These had flowed
bodily downwards, and others had rolled down as pellets.&nbsp;
Hence it is certain that as long as a mound of this kind is
tenanted by worms, its height will be continually lowered.&nbsp;
The fine earth which flows or rolls down the sides of such a
mound accumulates at its base in the form of a talus.&nbsp; A
bed, even a very thin bed, of fine earth is eminently favourable
for worms; so that a greater number of castings would tend to be
ejected on a talus thus formed than elsewhere; and these would be
partially washed away by every heavy shower and be spread over
the adjoining level ground.&nbsp; The final result would be the
lowering of the whole mound, whilst the inclination of the sides
would not be greatly lessened.&nbsp; The same result would
assuredly follow with ancient embankments and tumuli; except
where they had been formed of gravel or of nearly pure sand, as
such matter is unfavourable for worms.&nbsp; Many old
fortifications and tumuli are believed to be at least 2000 years
old; and we should bear in mind that in many places about one
inch of mould is brought to the surface in 5 years or two inches
in 10 years.&nbsp; Therefore in so long a period as 2000 years, a
large amount of earth will have been repeatedly brought to the
surface on most old embankments and tumuli, especially on the
talus round their bases, and much of this earth will have been
washed completely away.&nbsp; We may therefore conclude that all
ancient mounds, when not formed of materials unfavourable to
worms, will have been somewhat lowered in the course of
centuries, although their inclinations may not have been greatly
changed.</p>
<p><i>Fields formerly ploughed</i>.&mdash;From a very remote
period and in many countries, land has been ploughed, so that
convex beds, called crowns or ridges, usually about 8 feet across
and separated by furrows, have been thrown up.&nbsp; The furrows
are directed so as to carry off the surface water.&nbsp; In my
attempts to ascertain how long a time these crowns and furrows
last, when ploughed land has been converted into pasture,
obstacles of many kinds were encountered.&nbsp; It is rarely
known when a field was last ploughed; and some fields which were
thought to have been in pasture from time immemorial were
afterwards discovered to have been ploughed only 50 or 60 years
before.&nbsp; During the early part of the present century, when
the price of corn was very high, land of all kinds seems to have
been ploughed in Britain.&nbsp; There is, however, no reason to
doubt that in many cases the old crowns and furrows have been
preserved from a very ancient period. <a
name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269"
class="citation">[269]</a>&nbsp; That they should have been
preserved for very unequal lengths of time would naturally follow
from the crowns, when first thrown up, having differed much in
height in different districts, as is now the case with recently
ploughed land.</p>
<p>In old pasture fields, the mould, wherever measurements were
made, was found to be from &frac12; to 2 inches thicker in the
furrows than on the crowns; but this would naturally follow from
the finer earth having been washed from the crowns into the
furrows before the land was well clothed with turf; and it is
impossible to tell what part worms may have played in the
work.&nbsp; Nevertheless from what we have seen, castings would
certainly tend to flow and to be washed during heavy rain from
the crowns into the furrows.&nbsp; But as soon as a bed of fine
earth had by any means been accumulated in the furrows, it would
be more favourable for worms than the other parts, and a greater
number of castings would be thrown up here than elsewhere; and as
the furrows on sloping land are usually directed so as to carry
off the surface water, some of the finest earth would be washed
from the castings which had been here ejected and be carried
completely away.&nbsp; The result would be that the furrows would
be filled up very slowly, while the crowns would be lowered
perhaps still more slowly by the flowing and rolling of the
castings down their gentle inclinations into the furrows.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it might be expected that old furrows, especially
those on a sloping surface, would in the course of time be filled
up and disappear.&nbsp; Some careful observers, however, who
examined fields for me in Gloucestershire and Staffordshire could
not detect any difference in the state of the furrows in the
upper and lower parts of sloping fields, supposed to have been
long in pasture; and they came to the conclusion that the crowns
and furrows would last for an almost endless number of
centuries.&nbsp; On the other hand the process of obliteration
seems to have commenced in some places.&nbsp; Thus in a grass
field in North Wales, known to have been ploughed about 65 years
ago, which sloped at an angle of 15&deg; to the north-east, the
depth of the furrows (only 7 feet apart) was carefully measured,
and was found to be about 4&frac12; inches in the upper part of
the slope, and only 1 inch near the base, where they could be
traced with difficulty.&nbsp; On another field sloping at about
the same angle to the south-west, the furrows were scarcely
perceptible in the lower part; although these same furrows when
followed on to some adjoining level ground were from 2&frac12; to
3&frac12; inches in depth.&nbsp; A third and closely similar case
was observed.&nbsp; In a fourth case, the mould in a furrow in
the upper part of a sloping field was 2&frac12; inches, and in
the lower part 4&frac12; inches in thickness.</p>
<p>On the Chalk Downs at about a mile distance from Stonehenge,
my son William examined a grass-covered, furrowed surface,
sloping at from 8&deg; to 10 &deg;, which an old shepherd said
had not been ploughed within the memory of man.&nbsp; The depth
of one furrow was measured at 16 points in a length of 68 paces,
and was found to be deeper where the slope was greatest and where
less earth would naturally tend to accumulate, and at the base it
almost disappeared.&nbsp; The thickness of the mould in this
furrow in the upper part was 2&frac12; inches, which increased to
5 inches, a little above the steepest part of the slope; and at
the base, in the middle of the narrow valley, at a point which
the furrow if continued would have struck, it amounted to 7
inches.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the valley, there were very
faint, almost obliterated, traces of furrows.&nbsp; Another
analogous but not so decided a case was observed at a few
miles&rsquo; distance from Stonehenge.&nbsp; On the whole it
appears that the crowns and furrows on land formerly ploughed,
but now covered with grass, tend slowly to disappear when the
surface is inclined; and this is probably in large part due to
the action of worms; but that the crowns and furrows last for a
very long time when the surface is nearly level.</p>
<p><i>Formation and amount of mould over the Chalk
Formation</i>.&mdash;Worm-castings are often ejected in
extraordinary numbers on steep, grass-covered slopes, where the
Chalk comes close to the surface, as my son William observed near
Winchester and elsewhere.&nbsp; If such castings are largely
washed away during heavy rains, it is difficult to understand at
first how any mould can still remain on our Downs, as there does
not appear any evident means for supplying the loss.&nbsp; There
is, moreover, another cause of loss, namely, in the percolation
of the finer particles of earth into the fissures in the chalk
and into the chalk itself.&nbsp; These considerations led me to
doubt for a time whether I had not exaggerated the amount of fine
earth which flows or rolls down grass-covered slopes under the
form of castings; and I sought for additional information.&nbsp;
In some places, the castings on Chalk Downs consist largely of
calcareous matter, and here the supply is of course
unlimited.&nbsp; But in other places, for instance on a part of
Teg Down near Winchester, the castings were all black and did not
effervesce with acids.&nbsp; The mould over the chalk was here
only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness.&nbsp; So again on the plain
near Stonehenge, the mould, apparently free from calcareous
matter, averaged rather less than 3&frac12; inches in
thickness.&nbsp; Why worms should penetrate and bring up chalk in
some places and not in others I do not know.</p>
<p>In many districts where the land is nearly level, a bed
several feet in thickness of red clay full of unworn flints
overlies the Upper Chalk.&nbsp; This overlying matter, the
surface of which has been converted into mould, consists of the
undissolved residue from the chalk.&nbsp; It may be well here to
recall the case of the fragments of chalk buried beneath
worm-castings on one of my fields, the angles of which were so
completely rounded in the course of 29 years that the fragments
now resembled water-worn pebbles.&nbsp; This must have been
effected by the carbonic acid in the rain and in the ground, by
the humus-acids, and by the corroding power of living
roots.&nbsp; Why a thick mass of residue has not been left on the
Chalk, wherever the land is nearly level, may perhaps be
accounted for by the percolation of the fine particles into the
fissures, which are often present in the chalk and are either
open or are filled up with impure chalk, or into the solid chalk
itself.&nbsp; That such percolation occurs can hardly be
doubted.&nbsp; My son collected some powdered and fragmentary
chalk beneath the turf near Winchester; the former was found by
Colonel Parsons, R. E., to contain 10 per cent., and the
fragments 8 per cent. of earthy matter.&nbsp; On the flanks of
the escarpment near Abinger in Surrey, some chalk close beneath a
layer of flints, 2 inches in thickness and covered by 8 inches of
mould, yielded a residue of 3.7 per cent. of earthy matter.&nbsp;
On the other hand the Upper Chalk properly contains, as I was
informed by the late David Forbes who had made many analyses,
only from 1 to 2 per cent. of earthy matter; and two samples from
pits near my house contained 1.3 and 0.6 per cent.&nbsp; I
mention these latter cases because, from the thickness of the
overlying bed of red clay with flints, I had imagined that the
underlying chalk might here be less pure than elsewhere.&nbsp;
The cause of the residue accumulating more in some places than in
others, may be attributed to a layer of argillaceous matter
having been left at an early period on the chalk, and this would
check the subsequent percolation of earthy matter into it.</p>
<p>From the facts now given we may conclude that castings ejected
on our Chalk Downs suffer some loss by the percolation of their
finer matter into the chalk.&nbsp; But such impure superficial
chalk, when dissolved, would leave a larger supply of earthy
matter to be added to the mould than in the case of pure
chalk.&nbsp; Besides the loss caused by percolation, some fine
earth is certainly washed down the sloping grass-covered surfaces
of our Downs.&nbsp; The washing-down process, however, will be
checked in the course of time; for although I do not know how
thin a layer of mould suffices to support worms, yet a limit must
at last be reached; and then their castings would cease to be
ejected or would become scanty.</p>
<p>The following cases show that a considerable quantity of fine
earth is washed down.&nbsp; The thickness of the mould was
measured at points 12 yards apart across a small valley in the
Chalk near Winchester.&nbsp; The sides sloped gently at first;
then became inclined at about 20&deg;; then more gently to near
the bottom, which transversely was almost level and about 50
yards across.&nbsp; In the bottom, the mean thickness of the
mould from five measurements was 8.3 inches; whilst on the sides
of the valley, where the inclination varied between 14&deg; and
20&deg;, its mean thickness was rather less than 3.5
inches.&nbsp; As the turf-covered bottom of the valley sloped at
an angle of only between 2&deg; and 3&deg;, it is probable that
most of the 8.3-inch layer of mould had been washed down from the
flanks of the valley, and not from the upper part.&nbsp; But as a
shepherd said that he had seen water flowing in this valley after
the sudden thawing of snow, it is possible that some earth may
have been brought down from the upper part; or, on the other
hand, that some may have been carried further down the
valley.&nbsp; Closely similar results, with respect to the
thickness of the mould, were obtained in a neighbouring
valley.</p>
<p>St. Catherine&rsquo;s Hill, near Winchester, is 327 feet in
height, and consists of a steep cone of chalk about &frac14; of a
mile in diameter.&nbsp; The upper part was converted by the
Romans, or, as some think, by the ancient Britons, into an
encampment, by the excavation of a deep and broad ditch all round
it.&nbsp; Most of the chalk removed during the work was thrown
upwards, by which a projecting bank was formed; and this
effectually prevents worm-castings (which are numerous in parts),
stones, and other objects from being washed or rolled into the
ditch.&nbsp; The mould on the upper and fortified part of the
hill was found to be in most places only from 2&frac12; to
3&frac12; inches in thickness; whereas it had accumulated at the
foot of the embankment above the ditch to a thickness in most
places of from 8 to 9&frac12; inches.&nbsp; On the embankment
itself the mould was only 1 to 1&frac12; inch in thickness; and
within the ditch at the bottom it varied from 2&frac12; to
3&frac12;, but was in one spot 6 inches in thickness.&nbsp; On
the north-west side of the hill, either no embankment had ever
been thrown up above the ditch, or it had subsequently been
removed; so that here there was nothing to prevent worm-castings,
earth and stones being washed into the ditch, at the bottom of
which the mould formed a layer from 11 to 22 inches in
thickness.&nbsp; It should however be stated that here and on
other parts of the slope, the bed of mould often contained
fragments of chalk and flint which had obviously rolled down at
different times from above.&nbsp; The interstices in the
underlying fragmentary chalk were also filled up with mould.</p>
<p>My son examined the surface of this hill to its base in a
south-west direction.&nbsp; Beneath the great ditch, where the
slope was about 24&deg;, the mould was very thin, namely, from
1&frac12; to 2&frac12; inches; whilst near the base, where the
slope was only 3&deg; to 4&deg;, it increased to between 8 and 9
inches in thickness.&nbsp; We may therefore conclude that on this
artificially modified hill, as well as in the natural valleys of
the neighbouring Chalk Downs, some fine earth, probably derived
in large part from worm-castings, is washed down, and accumulates
in the lower parts, notwithstanding the percolation of an unknown
quantity into the underlying chalk; a supply of fresh earthy
matter being afforded by the dissolution of the chalk through
atmospheric and other agencies.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Summary of the part which worms have played in
the history of the world&mdash;Their aid in the disintegration of
rocks&mdash;In the denudation of the land&mdash;In the
preservation of ancient remains&mdash;In the preparation of the
soil for the growth of plants&mdash;Mental powers of
worms&mdash;Conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Worms</span> have played a more important
part in the history of the world than most persons would at first
suppose.&nbsp; In almost all humid countries they are
extraordinarily numerous, and for their size possess great
muscular power.&nbsp; In many parts of England a weight of more
than ten tons (10,516 kilogrammes) of dry earth annually passes
through their bodies and is brought to the surface on each acre
of land; so that the whole superficial bed of vegetable mould
passes through their bodies in the course of every few
years.&nbsp; From the collapsing of the old burrows the mould is
in constant though slow movement, and the particles composing it
are thus rubbed together.&nbsp; By these means fresh surfaces are
continually exposed to the action of the carbonic acid in the
soil, and of the humus-acids which appear to be still more
efficient in the decomposition of rocks.&nbsp; The generation of
the humus-acids is probably hastened during the digestion of the
many half-decayed leaves which worms consume.&nbsp; Thus the
particles of earth, forming the superficial mould, are subjected
to conditions eminently favourable for their decomposition and
disintegration.&nbsp; Moreover, the particles of the softer rocks
suffer some amount of mechanical trituration in the muscular
gizzards of worms, in which small stones serve as
mill-stones.</p>
<p>The finely levigated castings, when brought to the surface in
a moist condition, flow during rainy weather down any moderate
slope; and the smaller particles are washed far down even a
gently inclined surface.&nbsp; Castings when dry often crumble
into small pellets and these are apt to roll down any sloping
surface.&nbsp; Where the land is quite level and is covered with
herbage, and where the climate is humid so that much dust cannot
be blown away, it appears at first sight impossible that there
should be any appreciable amount of sub-aerial denudation; but
worm-castings are blown, especially whilst moist and viscid, in
one uniform direction by the prevalent winds which are
accompanied by rain.&nbsp; By these several means the superficial
mould is prevented from accumulating to a great thickness; and a
thick bed of mould checks in many ways the disintegration of the
underlying rocks and fragments of rock.</p>
<p>The removal of worm-castings by the above means leads to
results which are far from insignificant.&nbsp; It has been shown
that a layer of earth, 0.2 of an inch in thickness, is in many
places annually brought to the surface; and if a small part of
this amount flows, or rolls, or is washed, even for a short
distance, down every inclined surface, or is repeatedly blown in
one direction, a great effect will be produced in the course of
ages.&nbsp; It was found by measurements and calculations that on
a surface with a mean inclination of 9&deg; 26&prime;, 2.4 cubic
inches of earth which had been ejected by worms crossed, in the
course of a year, a horizontal line one yard in length; so that
240 cubic inches would cross a line 100 yards in length.&nbsp;
This latter amount in a damp state would weigh 11&frac12;
pounds.&nbsp; Thus a considerable weight of earth is continually
moving down each side of every valley, and will in time reach its
bed.&nbsp; Finally this earth will be transported by the streams
flowing in the valleys into the ocean, the great receptacle for
all matter denuded from the land.&nbsp; It is known from the
amount of sediment annually delivered into the sea by the
Mississippi, that its enormous drainage-area must on an average
be lowered .00263 of an inch each year; and this would suffice in
four and half million years to lower the whole drainage-area to
the level of the sea-shore.&nbsp; So that, if a small fraction of
the layer of fine earth, 0.2 of an inch in thickness, which is
annually brought to the surface by worms, is carried away, a
great result cannot fail to be produced within a period which no
geologist considers extremely long.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Arch&aelig;ologists ought to be grateful to worms, as they
protect and preserve for an indefinitely long period every
object, not liable to decay, which is dropped on the surface of
the land, by burying it beneath their castings.&nbsp; Thus, also,
many elegant and curious tesselated pavements and other ancient
remains have been preserved; though no doubt the worms have in
these cases been largely aided by earth washed and blown from the
adjoining land, especially when cultivated.&nbsp; The old
tesselated pavements have, however, often suffered by having
subsided unequally from being unequally undermined by the
worms.&nbsp; Even old massive walls may be undermined and
subside; and no building is in this respect safe, unless the
foundations lie 6 or 7 feet beneath the surface, at a depth at
which worms cannot work.&nbsp; It is probable that many monoliths
and some old walls have fallen down from having been undermined
by worms.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Worms prepare the ground <a name="citation284"></a><a
href="#footnote284" class="citation">[284]</a> in an excellent
manner for the growth of fibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings
of all kinds.&nbsp; They periodically expose the mould to the
air, and sift it so that no stones larger than the particles
which they can swallow are left in it.&nbsp; They mingle the
whole intimately together, like a gardener who prepares fine soil
for his choicest plants.&nbsp; In this state it is well fitted to
retain moisture and to absorb all soluble substances, as well as
for the process of nitrification.&nbsp; The bones of dead
animals, the harder parts of insects, the shells of
land-molluscs, leaves, twigs, &amp;c., are before long all buried
beneath the accumulated castings of worms, and are thus brought
in a more or less decayed state within reach of the roots of
plants.&nbsp; Worms likewise drag an infinite number of dead
leaves and other parts of plants into their burrows, partly for
the sake of plugging them up and partly as food.</p>
<p>The leaves which are dragged into the burrows as food, after
being torn into the finest shreds, partially digested, and
saturated with the intestinal and urinary secretions, are
commingled with much earth.&nbsp; This earth forms the dark
coloured, rich humus which almost everywhere covers the surface
of the land with a fairly well-defined layer or mantle.&nbsp;
Hensen <a name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285"
class="citation">[285]</a> placed two worms in a vessel 18 inches
in diameter, which was filled with sand, on which fallen leaves
were strewed; and these were soon dragged into their burrows to a
depth of 3 inches.&nbsp; After about 6 weeks an almost uniform
layer of sand, a centimeter (0.4 inch) in thickness, was
converted into humus by having passed through the alimentary
canals of these two worms.&nbsp; It is believed by some persons
that worm-burrows, which often penetrate the ground almost
perpendicularly to a depth of 5 or 6 feet, materially aid in its
drainage; notwithstanding that the viscid castings piled over the
mouths of the burrows prevent or check the rain-water directly
entering them.&nbsp; They allow the air to penetrate deeply into
the ground.&nbsp; They also greatly facilitate the downward
passage of roots of moderate size; and these will be nourished by
the humus with which the burrows are lined.&nbsp; Many seeds owe
their germination to having been covered by castings; and others
buried to a considerable depth beneath accumulated castings lie
dormant, until at some future time they are accidentally
uncovered and germinate.</p>
<p>Worms are poorly provided with sense-organs, for they cannot
be said to see, although they can just distinguish between light
and darkness; they are completely deaf, and have only a feeble
power of smell; the sense of touch alone is well developed.&nbsp;
They can therefore learn but little about the outside world, and
it is surprising that they should exhibit some skill in lining
their burrows with their castings and with leaves, and in the
case of some species in piling up their castings into tower-like
constructions.&nbsp; But it is far more surprising that they
should apparently exhibit some degrees of intelligence instead of
a mere blind instinctive impulse, in their manner of plugging up
the mouths of their burrows.&nbsp; They act in nearly the same
manner as would a man, who had to close a cylindrical tube with
different kinds of leaves, petioles, triangles of paper, &amp;c.,
for they commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends.&nbsp;
But with thin objects a certain number are drawn in by their
broader ends.&nbsp; They do not act in the same unvarying manner
in all cases, as do most of the lower animals; for instance, they
do not drag in leaves by their foot-stalks, unless the basal part
of the blade is as narrow as the apex, or narrower than it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we should
remember that its smoothness, on which so much of its beauty
depends, is mainly due to all the inequalities having been slowly
levelled by worms.&nbsp; It is a marvellous reflection that the
whole of the superficial mould over any such expanse has passed,
and will again pass, every few years through the bodies of
worms.&nbsp; The plough is one of the most ancient and most
valuable of man&rsquo;s inventions; but long before he existed
the land was in fact regularly ploughed, and still continues to
be thus ploughed by earth-worms.&nbsp; It may be doubted whether
there are many other animals which have played so important a
part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized
creatures.&nbsp; Some other animals, however, still more lowly
organized, namely corals, have done far more conspicuous work in
having constructed innumerable reefs and islands in the great
oceans; but these are almost confined to the tropical zones.</p>

class="footnote">[128]</a>&nbsp; These pits or pipes are still in
process of formation.&nbsp; During the last forty years I have
seen or heard of five cases, in which a circular space, several
feet in diameter, suddenly fell in, leaving on the field an open
hole with perpendicular sides, some feet in depth.&nbsp; This
occurred in one of my own fields, whilst it was being rolled, and
the hinder quarters of the shaft horse fell in; two or three
cart-loads of rubbish were required to fill up the hole.&nbsp;
The subsidence occurred where there was a broad depression, as if
the surface had fallen in at several former periods.&nbsp; I
heard of a hole which must have been suddenly formed at the
bottom of a small shallow pool, where sheep had been washed
during many years, and into which a man thus occupied fell to his
great terror.&nbsp; The rain-water over this whole district sinks
perpendicularly into the ground, but the chalk is more porous in
certain places than in others.&nbsp; Thus the drainage from the
overlying clay is directed to certain points, where a greater
amount of calcareous matter is dissolved than elsewhere.&nbsp;
Even narrow open channels are sometimes formed in the solid
chalk.&nbsp; As the chalk is slowly dissolved over the whole
country, but more in some parts than in others, the undissolved
residue&mdash;that is the overlying mass of red clay with
flints,&mdash;likewise sinks slowly down, and tends to fill up
the pipes or cavities.&nbsp; But the upper part of the red clay
holds together, aided probably by the roots of plants, for a
longer time than the lower parts, and thus forms a roof, which
sooner or later falls in, as in the above mentioned five
cases.&nbsp; The downward movement of the clay may be compared
with that of a glacier, but is incomparably slower; and this
movement accounts for a singular fact, namely, that the much
elongated flints which are embedded in the chalk in a nearly
horizontal position, are commonly found standing nearly or quite
upright in the red clay.&nbsp; This fact is so common that the
workmen assured me that this was their natural position.&nbsp; I
roughly measured one which stood vertically, and it was of the
same length and of the same relative thickness as one of my
arms.&nbsp; These elongated flints must get placed in their
upright position, on the same principle that a trunk of a tree
left on a glacier assumes a position parallel to the line of
motion.&nbsp; The flints in the clay which form almost half its
bulk, are very often broken, though not rolled or abraded; and
this may be accounted for by their mutual pressure, whilst the
whole mass is subsiding.&nbsp; I may add that the chalk here
appears to have been originally covered in parts by a thin bed of
fine sand with some perfectly rounded flint pebbles, probably of
Tertiary age; for such sand often partly fills up the deeper pits
or cavities in the chalk.</p>

letter (June 1838) to Sir C. Lyell, remarks that Scotch farmers
are afraid of putting lime on ploughed land until just before it
is laid down for pasture, from a belief that it has some tendency
to sink.&nbsp; He adds: &ldquo;Some years since, in autumn, I
laid lime on an oat-stubble and ploughed it down; thus bringing
it into immediate contact with the dead vegetable matter, and
securing its thorough mixture through the means of all the
subsequent operations of fallow.&nbsp; In consequence of the
above prejudice, I was considered to have committed a great
fault; but the result was eminently successful, and the practice
was <i>partially</i> followed.&nbsp; By means of Mr.

surprise at the complete disappearance of flints over wide and
nearly level areas, from which the chalk has been removed by
subaerial denudation.&nbsp; But the surface of every flint is
coated by an opaque modified layer, which will just yield to a
steel point, whilst the freshly fractured, translucent surface
will not thus yield.&nbsp; The removal by atmospheric agencies of
the outer modified surfaces of freely exposed flints, though no
doubt excessively slow, together with the modification travelling
inwards, will, as may be suspected, ultimately lead to their
complete disintegration, notwithstanding that they appear to be
so extremely durable.</p>

the vast amount of extremely fine chalky mud which is found
within the lagoons of many atolls, where the sea is tranquil and
waves cannot triturate the blocks of coral.&nbsp; This mud must,
as I believe (&lsquo;The Structure and Distribution of
Coral-Reefs,&rsquo; 2nd edit. 1874, p. 19), be attributed to the
innumerable annelids and other animals which burrow into the dead
coral, and to the fishes, Holothurians, &amp;c., which browse on
the living corals.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
